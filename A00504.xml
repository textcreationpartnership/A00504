            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Surely the Lorde God will do nothing, but he reuealeth his secrete vnto his seruantes the prophets. The Lion hath roared: who will not be afraide? the Lorde God hath spoken: who can but prophesie?</hi> And this seriously pondred may make all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful afraide lest the fulnesse of vs Gentiles be welneere come in, and lest our posteritie and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
<pb facs="tcp:20823:4"/>shoulde be depriued of the worde of GOD, the meanes for the saluation of all Gods elect, and so be disinherited of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, wherein only is ioy, life, and happinesse for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore. For monstrous pride, cruell oppression, craftie dealing, vnsatiable coueteousnesse, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse of life so aboundeth, and there is such securitie in all, such contempt in many, and such negligence in the best, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer wee may hope for some good, so there is greate cause to feare much euill. Wherefore as the Churches in former times both before and since Christ, haue alwaies had this onely meanes to preuent Gods greater iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
<pb facs="tcp:20823:4"/>euen to breake off their sinnes by some rare kind of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and solemnly to renewe the couenant of God: so haue I according to the smale talent the Lorde hath bestowed vpon me, indeuoured with greate desire in this shorte treatise to lay open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the simple, the manner of the couenant between God and man, that our heartes beeing pricked with sorrowe for our sinnes, as theirs were which hearde <hi>Peter</hi> preach, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. and our soules melting for feare of Gods iudgementes, as did the hearte of <hi>Iosiah</hi> at the hearing of the lawe, 2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.11.19. wee may be stirred vp to lay holde of mercie, before the Lordes hande
<pb facs="tcp:20823:5"/>take holde on iudgement, and most solemnly to renewe the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant betweene God and vs, as the Iewes did both, <hi>Ezr. ca.</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. and <hi>Nehem. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. For except there be some reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by our repentance, and renewing of the couenant, whiles there is time and grace offered; it is vndoubtedly true, that the Lord will either weede out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong vs the great sinners, &amp; bring the rest into the bond of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as he did with the <hi>Israelites</hi> a little before they entred into the promised <hi>Canaan, Deut.</hi> 4.3.4. or else he will vtterly cast vs off, and giue vs vp to reprobation, and in his secret &amp; vnsearchable wisdom reserue a smal remnant according
<pb facs="tcp:20823:5"/>to the election of grace, as he did with the Iewes at the first cōming of Christ in the flesh. And because of our selues we are vntowarde to euery good work, &amp; plenty, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and security are greate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentes to many, my heartes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and prayer to God hath beene and is, that he would breed in vs by his holy spirit like feeling of our sinnes as <hi>Salomon</hi> had after his fall, and like affection as he had, that we may say as he did in the booke of repentance, which commonly is called the booke of the preacher, <hi>vanity of vanities, saith the preacher: vanity of vanities, all is vanity, &amp;c.</hi> throughout that whole book, and so treading vnder our feet whatso euer in this world hindreth vs from
<pb facs="tcp:20823:6"/>godlines, we may haue our minds set on heauenly things, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence run the race that is set before vs, looke stedfastly vnto Iesus Christ, the author and finisher of our faith, and lastlie receiue the ende of our faith, euen the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our soules. In the meane space I humblie beseech all that feare God vnfainedly and from their heartes, that for the tender mercies of God in Iesus Christ, for the continuance of the Gospel amonge vs, for our posterities and successours sakes, who shall possesse the earth for their time when we are gone and swept away, that they woulde not cease night nor day continually to be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate with the Lord by earnest &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:20823:6"/>heartie praier for the continuance and increase of his graces, that true godlinesse may dwell in our lande, and abundance of peace with all prosperitie whiles the sun and moone endure, knowing that the prayer of a righteous man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth much if it be feruent.</p>
            <p>Nowe right worshipfull, and my deare brethren in Christ, though in needeth not to render any reasons why I dedicate this smale treatise to you, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to omitte others, these two causes I thinke meete heere to be mentioned. First that this may be a publike testimonie of the heartie loue which you be are to the Gospell of Iesus Christ, and which you haue plentifully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:20823:7"/>many waies to the glorie of God, the comfort of others, and the peace of your owne soules. Secondly that by this meanes I may declare the loue that I beare not onely to all that call on the name of the Lord in sinceritie, but specially to you who haue often heard the chiefe pointes of those things pulikly deliuered, which are heere set downe in writing. And if heerein the Lord my God vouch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>safe me this fauor, as that I may be his instrument (though most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, as he knowth very well) to minister some smale comfort to any of the least of his seruantes, I shall obtaine the thing I specially desire of GOD through Iesus Christ our Lorde. The God of
<pb facs="tcp:20823:7"/>glorie, and father of all mercies continue the Gospell of his sonne Iesus Christ among you for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>

            <p>Man was created in a blessed state, after the image of God, Gen. 1.26.27. <hi>Thus God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the man in his image: in the image of God created he him.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No, not in proportion of bodie (for God is a spirit, Iohn. 4.24. and not a bodie) but in inward graces of the minde, as in knowledge Coloss. 3.10. in righteousnesse and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Ephes. 4.24. and such like.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Quest. <hi>What? was man righteous, as God is righteous? was man good as God is good? was man holie, as God is holie? and was mans know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as much as Gods knowledge?</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> In these and such other graces, man after some sort resembleth God, and is like vnto him, but is not equall with God in any thing, for there is a dubble difference. First these properties are essentiall in God, and of his essence, so that he were no God if he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them: but in man they are accidentall, and the most part of men now want many of them. Secondly, they are in God in all fulnes, and without measure, as God is all goodnesse it selfe, all righteousnesse it selfe, all holines, all wisedome, all mercie, and so of all the rest: but in man they are in a certaine measure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Lord gaue them, &amp; as was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a creature. Wherefore we make not man equall with God, though we say that he was created like vnto God, and in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God in righteousnes, holines, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and such others.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The image of God in man.</note> These graces before mentioned, and such like, are the image of God in man. And they consist partly in the minde indued with such excellent wisedome, that he could giue apt and proper names to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the earth, Gen. 2.20. and spake of

First, if our sinnes committed before baptisme and before our regeneration were so great that they could not be purged by any mans works, but the death and blodsheding of Iesus Christ was necessarily required to wash vs and make vs cleane; then I say that sinne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after regeneration, can in no wise be purged by workes of men, but only by the bloud of Christ: My reason is, because sinne is alwayes of one nature, though some sinnes be greater then other. And because sinnes committed after Baptisme are greater then sinnes committed before regeneration. For be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore regeneration wee walke in darkenesse, (though we haue so much light as is sufficient to make vs excuseles) and so commit much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20823:22"/>sinne through ignorance: but after regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are in the light, we haue more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and greater power to resist sinne. And therefore sinne committed after regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is greater then the sinne committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the same degree. Wherefore if sinne committed before regeneration, cannot be purged but by the bloud of Christ, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that sinne after regeneration can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way be forgiuen then by Christ, whose death is effectuall and auailable aswell for sinnes after regeneration as before. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the greatest papist of them all, yea the Pope himselfe, I thinke, can doe no greater, nor no better workes then did the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> But he after his regeneration, fleeth to the mercie of God in Christ, and saith, Phil. 3.8.9. That he counteth all his righteousnes losse for Christes sake, and desireth to be found in him, not hauing his owne righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, euen the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes which is of God through faith. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore except the papists looke otherwise to be saued then <hi>Paul</hi> was, or haue better works then he had, they cannot be saued by them.

               <note place="margin">The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God vnder the gospel.</note> Yea, there ought to be, there hath beene, and is at this day, and shall be to the end of the world. When <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach the gospel, and gather a new Church, a new people for Christ, he renewed this couenant with all those whome he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For when the scripture Math. 3. witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he admitted none to baptisme, but vpon confession of their sinnes, which was both a renouncing of them, and also a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising of amendment of life, and of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God; and that many voluntarily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselues to his order, which was the ordinance of God, and receiued the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme, which is the signe of the couenant, and to be ministred to none, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them that are in the couenant: it is more then manifest, that <hi>Iohn</hi> gathering a holy people to the Lord out of that corrupt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred state of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> renewed the couenāt of God. when <hi>Peter</hi> conuerted so many at one sermon Act. 2.38.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20823:30"/>the couenant. The same is to be affirmed of those whome <hi>Paul</hi> conuerted, Act, 19.17.18. And afterward when the Apostle planted Churches in diuers places, it appeareth many wayes that they at the first made the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betweene God and them; els they could haue planted no Church.

For the sacraments are as necessarily annexed to faith, as the seale to an obligation.

               <hi>Ans.</hi> I will make it manifest foure waies. First, by the practise of the Church and of them that are regenerate. For when any heathen man is conuerted to the faith and baptised, and when any of the children of the faithfull are confirmed, then they, the Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, do openly before the Church renounce the flesh, the world, and the diuell, as hath beene shewed before.</p>

And so <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth this mystery, Rom. 6.3. <hi>Knowe ye not, that all we which haue beene baptised into Iesus Christ, haue beene bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised into his death? we are buried then with him by baptisme into his death, that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father, so

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">1. A spiritu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>al grace.</note> First there must be a spirituall and a heauenly thing promised by God. For where God promiseth nothing, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there can be no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe or element, no more then a seale set to a blanke. And when God promiseth earthly things which are subiect to our senses, then our senses are sufficient witnesses to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our mindes. But when the Lord promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20823:58"/>spirituall and heauenly things, which our senses cannot reach vnto, then we haue need, and the Lord hauing compassion on our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, helpeth our weaknesse, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient sensible things, setteth before our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses spirituall and heauenly thinges.</p>
            <p>First therefore it is requisite that to make a sacrament there be some speciall grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and that by God himselfe. For no man hath spirituall graces in his power to promise them to whom he will.</p>
            <p>

<note n="2" place="margin">2. A sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing</note> there must be some outward and sensible thing that may liuely represent vnto vs, and set before our senses that heauenly grace which is promised; that our outwarde senses perceiuing it, may conueygh the truth and certenty thereof vnto our mindes. For as light commeth into the house at the windows, so al the knowledge and vnderstanding which we haue, commeth into our mindes at the windowes of our outward senses, &amp; specially in at our eares and at our eies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the Lord himselfe must both chuse out that sensible thing which shall represent the spirituall grace,
<note n="3" place="margin">The insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of God.</note> and also by his own word and institution ordaine it, and all the manner of it, to that end and purpose. For as man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a heauenly promise, because heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges are not in his power to giue them to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20823:58"/>whom he will: so man may not without very great sinne presume to ordaine any outwarde thing to represent a heauenly thing, but this must be done by the Lord onely.</p>

               <note place="margin">The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the seale both of God &amp; mā.</note> Though there be no question but that it is the seale of God; yet it shall not be a misse so say it is the seale of the faithfull also.

And for that cause haue I vsed moe wordes, as for example; Because all men are sinners Eccle. 7.31. and sinners shall not stand before God Ps. 5.5. nor inherit the kingdome of God, 1. Cor. 6.9. Therefore it is necessarie that our sinnes be perdonned and doone away, that we may be acceptable to God and capable of the kingdome of heauen. And because God hath giuen this generall law, Gen. 2.17. That whensoeuer man sinned, he should certainly die the death: and to satisfie his owne iustice gaue his only begotten sonne to take our nature of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and be man as we are in all things (sinne only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Heb. 4.15. and laid vpon him the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vs all, Esai. 53.6.

And because Christ hath fulfilled the whole law for vs, and imputeth his righteousnes to vs that beleue in him, therefore I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vnder that spirituall grace, the meanes which God ordeined for our saluation and redemption.

            </p>

There seeme to me to be two causes whence this custome may come into the Church, but of whether of them twaine, or of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, but rather of some other I will not determine. I will onely reporte them, and so leaue them to the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the godly and the wise.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The first cause is commonly in euerie mans mouth, and it is this: In former times of the primitiue Church when infidels were conuerted to the faith of Christ, they came into the congregation, and openly renounced the flesh, the worlde, and the diuell, then made confession of their faith in GOD, and promised obedience to the commaundementes of God, and so final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were baptised, as diuers auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe recorde. Nowe some men are of opinion, that from this custome was taken this order in the Church, that the children of the faithfull shoulde haue Godfathers and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20823:65"/>Godmothers to answere for them when they were baptised, because they could not aunswere for themselues. Whether it were <hi>Hyginus</hi> of Rome that first brought vp this order about the yeare of Christ 140. as <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> and others write, or some other, it is not greatly materiall. The reasons which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the first authors to ordaine this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, as <hi>Gratian</hi> the marrer of the popes lawes (<hi>Auent. lib.</hi> 6.) hath set them downe <hi>C.</hi> 13. <hi>Q.</hi> 1. <hi>C. quod autem, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>de conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratione, dist.</hi> 4. in many Chapters, I will not at this present rehearse, but referre my selfe and the reader to the iudgement of <hi>M. Bucer</hi> in his censure vpon this question. For he was a man that loued our nation, and came out of Germanie to helpe vs, and though he builded vs not a synagogue, yet he commended to King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, in his bookes <hi>de regno Christi</hi> the platforme of the spirituall house of God, and how it ought to be builded.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second cause I gather by coniecture out of the fifth counsell of <hi>Carthage, Chap.</hi> 6. and it is this. About <hi>Carthage</hi> and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially further westward in that continent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Moriscos</hi> or <hi>Moores,</hi> it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened through hostile inuasions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the barbarous people, that many
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20823:66"/>christians were taken captiues, and some of them being young children. But when the Christians long after redeemed such as were taken captiues in their infancie, there grew a question, whether those were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised before they were caried captiues or not. At <hi>Carthage</hi> about the yeare of Christe, 430. there were 73. learned men, <hi>Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> being a chiefe man among them, assembled in a councell to determine of the causes of the Church &amp; among other thinges they consulted of this also, what was to be saide or done touching those of whome there was no certentie whether they were baptised or no. This question they handled the rather, because the christians among the <hi>Moores</hi> sent their messengers to <hi>Carthage</hi> for counsell in that case. Heereon I comecture that the worthy fathers of the Church to preuent such doubtes afrerward, ordained that there shoulde be speciall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses at the baptisme of euery christians childe, which thing if they did, I suppose it was a very laudable decree, though at this day, the Lord be praised, there is no such cause, except among them of <hi>Hungaria, Austria, Slauonia</hi> and others bordering v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the <hi>Turkes</hi> dominions, or vpon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insidell nation.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Not so. For though I will not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely affirme what was the very cause of the first beginning of this custome, yet there may bee good causes rendered why there shoulde be.

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20823:67"/>is baptisme. Secondly the children of the faithfull belong to the kingdome of heauen, <hi>Math.</hi> 19.14. and therefore ought to be baptised. Thirdly if the reasons seeme too too general in that manner I haue deliuered them (for I confesse a wrangling sophister may take exception against them) I will reason as <hi>Peter</hi> doth <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47. <hi>Can any man forbid water, &amp;c.</hi> that is, those which haue receiued the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost as well as we ought to be baptised. But children of the faithfull haue receiued the holy Ghost. This I prooue first because they are in Gods couenant, <hi>Gen,</hi> 17.7. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly because they are holy (that is to say, are sanctified, and haue receiued the holy Ghost) if but one of their parentes be faithful 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. and much more when both their parents are faithfull. Thirdly, because that if the first fruites be holy, so is the whole lumpe also: and if the roote be holy, so are the branches also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16.

And baptisme doth not make them Christians that were none before, but is the sacrament, the seale, the signe, the badge of them that are Christians before. As men become not seruantes to greate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages by putting on their coate with their badge, but first are receiued of some greate personage into his seruice and then after put on his coate and weare his badge

But it is the contemning or despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the sacrament that depriueth men of Gods fauour, when they make no more account of it then Esau did of his birth-right, Gen. 25.32. then Ahaz did of the Lords helpe Esay. 7. and it is also the neglecting of it, when God offreth time &amp;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20823:69"/>oportunitie that we might haue it. And as many neglect the heareing of the word &amp; say they can heare it when they list: so many neglect to offer their children to the Church in the Lords due time, and thinke they may haue them baptized when they will. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Lord neuer saide, that whosoeuer died vncircumcised, or vnbaptised should be wiped out of the booke of life: but he hath saide, Gen. 17.12.14. That whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer contemneth or carelesly neglecteth the sacrament, shalbe cut off from among his people. As if a maister should say of his seruant, if he despise my cloth, or if he will not put it on when I bid him, thrust such a fellow out at the dores, let him tary no longer in my house. Wherefore there is no danger to them that die before they can conueniently be baptized. But they had neede to take heede which neglect and pretermit the time when God doth offer it, and will tary for their friendes, as though the presence of their friendes were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the pleasure of God. And for this cause it seemeth that God now and then shewes greate tokens of his wrath by taking out of this life lustie and strong childrē without baptisme, because their parents neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the time which God offered.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> These matters are not to be ruled by mens desires, but by the word of God. When a childe is baptized, he is receiued into the fellowship of that congregation as a member thereof, and hath his name rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred among the Saintes.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That practise was holie and good, and may verie well be vsed,
<note place="margin">Baptisme ministred by sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on of water.</note> and rather then sprinkling on of water in hote countries. But in these northeren and cold climates it might be dangerous to the young and weak infant, as perhaps it hath beene to some, and that is the cause why now water is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sprinkled on children, then they put into the water. And least you should think this to be humane reason repugnant to the word of God, I would haue you to consider; First, that in the ould ceremoniall law there was purgation aswell by sprincling, Num. 19.9. as by washing Exod. 30.18.19. Leuit. 14.6.16.4. Secondly, that Cornelius &amp; a great number with him were baptized in his house as it semeth Act. 10.47. Paul was baptized in the house of one Iudas of Damascus Act. 8.11 18. the keeper of the prison at Phillippi with all that belonged vnto him, were baptized in his house about midnight Act. 16.33.

And there are with vs very many that doe as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, that is, lie groning, mourning, and sometimes weeping vpon their beddes in their sicknes, and cry out, yea roare for paine, and tumble from one side of the bed to the other, and out of one bed, or out of one cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into another, and finde no comfort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cry not vnto the Lord that laid that sicknes vpon them, eyther for their sinnes, or triall of their faith and patience, or to awake them out of securitie, or for some other cause.

And the world is so full of these, that he is counted a busie bodie that reproueth a blasphemous oath, and defendes the trueth.

               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lordforbiddeth them to make any grauen images, or to bow downe to them <hi>vers.</hi> 4. and in the beginning of <hi>vers.</hi> 5. which cannot be vnderstood as though these images were Gods (for the first commaundement forbad all other Gods besides the Lord who is God alone) but as they represent God, that so he may be worshipped by images. Wherefore the Lord heere forbiddeth them to make any grauen or molten image to represent him, &amp; so thereby to worship him. And the summe is, as if he had said, ye shal not make any image to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20823:89"/>me, neither shal ye worship me by such images. Now in that the Lord forbiddeth this worshiping of himself by images, we must vnder stand that he cōmādeth the cōtrary, that is, they must so worship him as he himself prescribeth.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Quest. <hi>Seeing you haue laid down two branches of the commaundement; first making of images to represent God by them, and secondly worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God by images: both which are forbidden, I pray you open both these more plainely. And first why doth God forbid vs to make an image like vnto himselfe, or to resemble him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There may be many reasons alledged why the Lord is not to be represented by any image, and first it ought to be a sufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to euery godly man, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doth heere expressely forbid it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Lorde in giuing of these ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, of purpose vttred his voice that the people might heare him, but appeared not vnto them in any visible forme, because they should not make any fimilitude or likenes of him. Thirdly seeing God appeared not, nor was not seene, for no man hath seene God at any time neyther can see him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20. &amp; 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. &amp; 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.12. it followeth that there is not, neyther can be any image of God, because there is neyther painter nor gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nor any other artificer that can make the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20823:89"/>similitude of that he neuer saw, nor no other man that could describe it vnto him. Fourthly, there is nothing in heauen, nor in earth that is like vnto God. For God is a spirit, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4.24. and not a creature and therefore cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled by any creature. Fiftly, they that haue attempted any such wicked thing, as to make an image of God, they haue shewed their folly by their dissenting one from another, when some haue painted God after one fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and some after an other, that their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes may be derided, as <hi>Dionysius</hi> derided the superstitious heathen in his daies,
<note place="margin">Cic. lib. 3. de natur. deor.</note> &amp; tooke away a golden beard from <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> saying it was an vnseemely sight that the son should be made with a beard, seeing his father was made without. Sixtly, they that haue tempted to make any similitude of God haue sinned, &amp; the Lord hath punished them, Ro. 1.23.24.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Quest. <hi>Seeing there are so many reasons why they neither could make any image of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were permitted to do so, how commeth it to passe that God forbids them to worship him by an image. For if they might not make an image of God, yea if they could not make an image of him, it seemeth a needlesse thing to prohibite them to worship him by any such image. And yet that you noted as the second branch of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I pray you therefore shew me the reason.</hi>

               <hi>Ans. Ierome</hi> in his commentaries vpon the second chapter of <hi>Hosea</hi> hath a true sentence, <hi>Omnia idola ex mortuorum errore creuerunt, Al</hi> (this kinde of) <hi>idolatrie hath his beginning of an error conceiued of the dead.</hi> The reason and manner whereof is largely described by <hi>Plato, Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>de legibus. Laertius de vitis philosoph. Tull. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de natur. deor. Plini. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. The booke of Wisedome, <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>vers.</hi> 14.15.16. <hi>Tertul. apolog. cap.</hi> 10. &amp; 11. &amp; 12. <hi>&amp;c. Ciprian de vanitate idolorum</hi> &amp; others. But the summe of all is this, as neare as I can collect it from the beginning. <hi>Ninus</hi> the first great conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Assyria,</hi> to gaine more fame to himselfe, commaunded that his father <hi>Belus</hi> being dead should be resēbled by an image made after his liknes, &amp; honored for a God. And for the same cause built a tēple for him in <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; therin set vp his image, which <hi>Plinie</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. was there to be seene in his daies, which was about 80. yeares after Christ. The image was made like to <hi>Belus,</hi> and when the people bowed themselues to that image, they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped <hi>Belus</hi> and not the image. From this beginning of idolatrie first deuised by <hi>Ninus</hi> (not by <hi>Terah</hi> the father of <hi>Haran,</hi> as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> saith) did the like superstition spread it selfe among all nations: and cruell tyrants in euery country, after their death were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20823:90"/>for Gods and worshipped by their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. And briefly to go forward with these new Gods a little before I apply it to this commaundement, I will passe ouer all other nations, yea the <hi>Grecians</hi> that abounded with these kindes of Gods, and in a word note the ripe wits of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who though they recei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued this deuise from others, yet after they once found it, haue surpassed alothers, and of whom it is commonly said: <hi>Roma alios deos recepit, Caesares dedit,</hi> Rome receiued all their other gods (which were before that time) but they haue made their Emperours to be Gods, euer since they had any. And for their Emperours Ireferre the reader to <hi>Herodian</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his fourth booke, where vpon the death of <hi>Seuerus</hi> he sheweth that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours were consecrated for Gods which left eyther sonnes or other to succeede them in the Empyre. The manner of the consecration he also declareth at large, that they had ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage made like to the dead Emperour, which the laide in a bed, and for seauen daies space the Senators sate on the left side of the bed, and the noble matrones on the right side, and phisicians came daily to visite that sicke image in the bed. After seauen daies, as though the Emperour were newe dead, the noble young men of the citie caried the dead image
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20823:91"/>into the open place called <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> &amp; put into it a costly tent filled with all kind of sweete odors, and after great solemnitie the senatos first, and then all the rest put fire to the tent, and when all was on a fire and a smoke, one let an Aegle fly out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of the tent in the sight of all the people, and that Aegle was supposed to cary the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours soule to heauen, and so was he conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated for a God euer afterward, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by an image. And now to goe a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the most holy Popes of Rome inferiours to none in all kinde of abhomination, haue thought it a chiefe point of their glory to be as skilfull in making Gods as any heathen, and therefore haue learned this of them, to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and make new gods (they cal them saints, but they iuggle when they say so to be cast a mist before mens eyes, for their owne booke of ceremonies calleth it <hi>Apotheosis,</hi> that is, dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying) whom so euer they list. And as <hi>Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> describeth the heathen consecration of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: so the booke of the ceremonies of the Church of Rome, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 6. declareth the blasphemous deifying of popish Gods. The chiefe pointes be these. First some men desirous to leaue his friende consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a God after his death, goes to that cursed <hi>Calphas</hi> the Pope, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20823:91"/>his friende to haue liued a most holy catholike popish life, desireth his holinesse to consecrate him. Secondly the pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes inquirie to be made of that dead person whether he were a right papist in his life time. Thirdly the Pope propoundes the matter to the company of Cardinals to see what they say to it. Fourthly the Pope and his crewe inquire more diligently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that mans life was saintish as any sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miticall frier or monke. Fiftly that antichrist with his crew consult whether the mans life was such that he deserues nowe to be made a God. Sixtly they decree to make him a God. Seauenthly there must be a great courte of the Pope his Cardinals, Patriarkes, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Bishops, and Abbots holden to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the matter againe. Eightly the time and place are appointed for the deifying of that dead person. Lastly when they come to doe the deede, first there is great solemnity of many antichristian ceremonies, secondly that beast that counterfeites the lambe, but speakes like the dragon, he makes that dead man a GOD after this manner: <hi>Ad hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem sanctae &amp; indiuiduae Trinitatis, &amp; exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem fidei catholicae, ac Christianae religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis augmentum: authoritate ciusdem Dei om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentis, Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiritus sancti,

Statuentes, vt ab vniuersali ecclefia anno quolibet in dei taelife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum ipsius &amp; officium deuotè &amp; solenniter cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bretur.</hi> In english thus: For the honor of the holy Trinitie, and for the aduancement of the catholike faith and Christian religion: we with the aduise of our brethren, by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the same almightie God, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, and of the blessed Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; by our own authority do decree &amp; appoint N. of worthy memory to be a saint, &amp; to be registred among the saintes, and we doe inrole his name in the same kalender. Commaunding the catholike Church deuotely and with solemnity to celebrate his feast and worship euery yeare vpon such a day (as shalbe nominated.) And thus that Antichrist of Rome makes new gods and hath made mo then his kalender wil hold, I meane moe then there are daies in the yeare &amp; for that cause he hath put out oftē one of his old gods, to prouide a place in the kalender, &amp; a day in the yere to worship his new God. But now to turn to the cōmandement, and to your question, the Lord giuing his people speciall
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20823:92"/>warning of the superstitiō of al heathens round about them, who had many Gods &amp; worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their Gods by Images, doeth in this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement expressely forbid <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi> to worshippe him by any Image, that they should not be like the heathen. And for this cause the Lord appeared not in the likenesse of any thing when he gaue the law, but only caused them to heare his voice. For this cause the Lord in plaine words forbiddeth them to make any Image to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him. And to shew how he detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Idolatrie, and to admonish them often and euery way; he saith further, that they shall not fall downe before any such Image to doe him any worship, that if the <hi>Israelites</hi> doe so at any time, they shalbe without al excuse. And hereby it appeareth how grossely the papists sinned, and how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely against the wordes; and against the sense and meaning of this commaundement. For they haue Images of God the father, &amp; of the sonne, and of the holy Ghost, directly against this commaundement. Againe when they say they worship not the Images, but God by the Images, that also you see is here statly forbidden. And to fulfil the measure of iniquitie, they haue made other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Lord, euen those which they cal
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20823:93"/>Saints as I shewed before. But that the pope consecrated them for Gods and not for saints, it is manifest: for if they were faithfull belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, they were Saints before, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning of euery epistle almost calleth the faithfull Saints. If they were no Saints in this life, the Pope could not make them Saints afterward, neither did he professe so to do. Secondly the Pope appointed sabbaths and dayes of rest for them, that they might those dayes be worshipped. Thirdly the Pope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a speciall seruice and worship to be doone to euery one of them, on their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sabbaths. Fourthly the Pope appointed their Images to be made, &amp; that men prostrate before their Images should worship thē. fiftly appointed that men should prayvnto them al, and seuerally to each of them for seuerall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions: Al these and diuers such other things shew that the pope consecrated them for Gods, against the first cōmandement. And that popish Images should be made against this cōmandement. And hereby you maysee what acount is to be made of popish Images. </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lord here forbiddeth to make any Image or any similitude to represent or resemble him: for he is not like to any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature

But otherwise it is not simply vnlawful to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie Image of other things. For God himselfe called <hi>Betzaleel</hi> and <hi>Aheleab Exod.</hi> 31.1.6. and filled them with the spirit of wisdome in all necessarie arts for the tabernacle, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue &amp; make <hi>Cherubims Exod.</hi> 25.18. &amp; 36.1. to embroider <hi>Aarons</hi> garments, to make bels and pomegranats for the skirts of his garment <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.3.4.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No, there are many reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. First, <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 25, &amp;c. and <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 28.11.19. had expresse warrant and commaundement for that they did. Secondly, it appeareth. Heb; 8. &amp; 9. &amp; &amp;. 10. that the Tabernacle, and the Temple with al their furniture, were types and figures to represent before the eyes of <hi>Israel</hi> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall worship of God vnder the Gospel, and the glorious bewtie of that spirituall house and temple, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. and <hi>Paul.

And thus you see there was good reason for those Images vnder the law. But there is not the like reason for vs now. For first, we haue no warrant, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> had, to set Images in our Churches, and so it were sinne for vs to doe without warrant. Secondly, it were to turne them from a ciuil vse, to a religious vse, and so they should be conteined in the first table and against this commaundement. Thirdly, if they were set in Churches for ornaments,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20823:94"/>that were to bring againe the abolished ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and to darken the true and perfect bewtie of the Church of Christ, which stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in outward painted walles, but in holynes and righteousnes in mens heartes, wordes, aad deedes, in hearing of the word, receiuing of the sacraments, and all other things which Christ hath commaunded.</p>

The most parte of Christians in these dayes are sicke of this disease, and think all is wel which they mean well, in coming to the Church when they list, and going out in prayer, in receiuing
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20823:96"/>both the sacraments when, where, and how they please, and if they haue giuen offence to the whole congregation, they wil make satisfaction as they please, and so the word of God is not the rule of their life, and the minister standes for a Cypher to do what they bid him. But because they must all of them appeare before the Iudgement seate of God, let them heare before, how acceptable to God these their prayers be, such receiuing of the sacraments is, and generally how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table all such will-worships, and good intents be to God. For thus saith the Lord. <hi>He that killeth a bullocke, (is as acceptable to me as) if he slew a man: he that sacrificeth a sheepe as if he cut of a dogges necke: he that offreth an oblation, as if he offred swines blood: he that remembreth incense, as if he blessed an I dol: yea they haue chosen their owne wayes, and their soule deligheth in their abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Esai: 66.3.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Quest. <hi>What if by Gods prouidence we liue in a Church where many abuses are, and God is not so purely worshipped as he requireth in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement? shall we therefore breake off al fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with that Church, in Gods worship, and goe to some other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There hath not yet been any Church, as I suppose, which hath not had her wantes and imperfections, as in the Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> of <hi>Iames,</hi> of <hi>Iohn,</hi> of <hi>Iude,</hi> it appeareth there were foule blemishes in the best Churches in the Apostles daies, and since alwaies haue beene, and now are, that a man cannot tell whither to goe, if he may not abide in that Church where diuers imperfections are. Wherefore I suppose many thinges are to be tolerated before we separate our selues from the Church, though euery man must keepe his owne handes thus farre cleane and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polluted,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20823:97"/>that he doe no such thinges him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to iustifie, vphold, or countenance such abuses, but onely tolerate and suffer that he cannot redresse. And thus I suppose a man is bound to abide in the felowship of the Church so long as the foundation is holden, and Iesus Christ onely preached to be the alone saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of Gods elect, and the true sacramentes of the Lord be administred; though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there be many abuses. I knowe, for my part, of fewe such separations that haue bene commendably made any where since Christ was vpon the earth, though all ages since his ascention witnes that great corruptions and foule abuses haue beene in euery Church of any note without exception. Of all other Churches, the Church of Rome that a long time boare sway ouer all Churches in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope almost (the Grecians were neuer vnder the yoke of that antichrist) hath beene the worst, and degenerated most, euen from a true Oliue into a wild Oliue, from the spouse of Christ to be the synagogue of Satan, &amp; yet few separations were made from that Church, till now of late yeares, when the prophesies of the reuelation were accomplished, and all generally almost went out of <hi>Babylon</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and separated themselues from her. And the whole worlde seemes to approue
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20823:97"/>this separation to be made by God, that sent so many and so mighty deliuerers. That sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration e the <hi>Waldenses</hi> or poore brethren of Lyons in Fraunce was commendable and praise worthy, though I remember not the like to haue happened in all popery, but many saintes of God, and many whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches liued vnder the Popes yoke, and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many grieuous things till the time of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance came. Againe I tremble to remember some separations that haue beene made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the abuses that were in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as the <hi>Nouatians</hi> separated themselues from all other Churches; so afterward did the <hi>Donatistes:</hi> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> were not farre from such opinions: and nowe in our daies <hi>Anabaptistes</hi> forsake the fellowship of the Churches, and all these vnder coloure of holinesse, because they would liue most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and obediently to the commandements of God, and because they coulde not beare with some wantes that were in the Churches. But into what foule and grosse opinions, I meane heresies, these separating themselues, did fall, the learned knowe, and I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it not greately necessarie heere to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lord saith plainly, <hi>Deu.</hi> 24.16. <hi>The fathers shall not be put to death for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor the children put to death for the fathers, but euery man shall be put to death for his owne sinne.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4.20. <hi>The same soule that sinneth shall die, yea</hi> the Lord saith. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21.23. <hi>If the wicked will returne from all his sinnes that he hath committed, and keepe all my statutes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he shall surely liue, and shall not die.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I reason thus, that if the Lorde, wil par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the sinner himselfe when he repenteth, it is very certaine he will not punish the child for that offence which is pardoned vpon the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers repentance. Therefore if you marke the wordes, you may easely perceiue there is no such thing heere said as you suppose. For the Lord doth not absolutely say he wil visite the children of the breakers of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to the third &amp; fourth generation: but he addeth this clause, <hi>of them that hate me,</hi> as if he had said, if the father hate me and breake this commandement, then will I with greate ielousie and anger visit him and punish him for his sinne.

Is there not as great equity in the one as in thother?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Me thinke you should not find fault ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the length of Gods mercies, or with the shortnes of his iudgements. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding because you propound the question, I answer, that where the Lord in respect of mans sins &amp; desarts by reason of sin, and of his own iustice, might iustly extend his anger to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands &amp; thousands: yet it pleaseth him to shew mercy in respect of his owne name &amp; glory, as it is manifest. <hi>Ezek,</hi> 20.9.14, 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.21.22.23 32. For all this is spoken to and of the Church of God, not to them that are without. And that which <hi>Moses</hi> speaketh of all <hi>Israel</hi> in generall, may proportionably be applied to the singular parts of <hi>Israel Deut.</hi> 32.26, 27. <hi>I said I woulde make their remembrance to cease from among men; Saue that I feared the fury of the enemy,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20823:99"/>least their aduersaries should wax proud, and lest they should say, Our hie hand, and not the Lorde hath done al this.</hi> The Lord that loueth his own vnto the end (Ioh. 13.1.) doth now and then punish them for their sins (<hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6.) and for that purpose giueth them into the hands of wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked mē, which being both his &amp; their enemies and yet the rod of Gods wrath, <hi>Esay.</hi> 10.5. do not chastice them for their amendement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lords meaning, but hauing once gotten them into their fingers, purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them vtterly, <hi>Esay.</hi> 10.6.7. &amp; reioice in the cruelty against Gods saints, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 25. and say they sin not against the Lord in so doing, <hi>Ier.</hi> 50.7, yea sometimes they exalt themselues blasphemously against the Lord himselfe, as though he could not saue his own people and deliuer them out of their handes, (<hi>Num.</hi> 14.16 &amp; 2. <hi>King.</hi> 18.35. <hi>Esay.</hi> 10.10.11.) therefore the Lord, hauing respect to his own glory, in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often remembreth mercy, staieth his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation, and receiueth his own people to mercy againe (<hi>Esay.</hi> 54.7.8.) though they deserued a longer punishment: &amp; then recompenceth his and their cruell blasphemous enemies seauen fold into their bosom, <hi>Esay</hi> 10.12.13. &amp; <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. And this is the cause why the Lordes wrath is extended but to the third &amp; fourth generation of them that breake his cōmandements, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to them that keepe his commaundementes
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20823:100"/>his mercy endure for euer.</p>
            <p>Que. <hi>What is to be obserued out of this reason?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, as in euery society men are kept in order, and drawen to perform their duty either by reward for doing wel, or by punishment for offending: so the lord in this cōmandemēt, that eyther he may allure vs with his mercies to keep his commandements, or with his iudgments ter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rifie vs from doing euil, setteth both before vs, that by one means or other he may keep vs frō working our own destruction. And if our mind were as earnestly bent after heauenly things; as after earthly things or if we gaue so much credit to God as we doe to men: then as we spare no labour, neither feare any peril by sea or land by night or day, in the city or in the desart, to get the reward that man promiseth: so should we much more giue our selues wholly to do the wil of God, that we &amp; our posterity to a thousand generations, might be blessed both temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eternally, with earthly &amp; with heauenly blessings for euer. But alas, when we carelesly neglect, or wilfully contemne the keeping of Gods cōmandementes, our works are an open profession before the world, &amp; our cōsciences are &amp; shalbe witnesses before God, that we nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther beseue the lords mercies, nor fear his iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments. They are counted litle better then mad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men that cōtemn the lawes of men, &amp; whē the iudge cōmeth &amp; sitteth on the bench their folly
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20823:100"/>appeareth For they are arreined, condemned, and executed. But they are counted wise men which despise Gods Laws &amp; tremble no more then stocks, to heare Gods terrible iudgments denounced both temporally and eternally against them and their posteritie. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse they shalbe brought to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when it will be too late to repent, and then shall they receiue their full punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We see many struggle with this worlde to scrape welth together for them and theirs; but they striue against the streame, it will not do with thē as they desire, the more they toyle, the faster it falleth from them like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the more reuenewes they haue, the poorer the wax (<hi>Hag.</hi> 1.) and that by the iust iudgement of God, who crosseth thē and visiteth them in all things they haue, and that because they worship him not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the rule of his owne word, but with the deuises of men, or with their good intents. And woulde to God such as professe Christ would spare but one howre of 24. to meditate vpon this commaundement, and in meditation thereof to compare their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state with it. For then should they see and learne, that the Lord blesseth them that loue him, crosseth them that hate him, and so amend what is amisse in them.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:20823:101"/>
            <p>Secondly, we learne out of this reason, that which the phophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> teacheth vs <hi>Lament.</hi> 3.22. <hi>It is the Lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions faile not.</hi> For when we worship God with our good intents &amp; when we will follow our owne and other mens deuises so stiffely &amp; obstinately, that though the Lord tell vs of it, and admonish vs out of his owne word, and by his ministers, yet will we stop our eares and perhappes hate him for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that is the messenger of such tidings: then the Lord, that might iustly wipe vs &amp; our posteritie out of the booke of life, doeth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in iudgement remember mercy (<hi>Habac.</hi> 3.2.) And for his owne names sake comforteth the third or the fourth generation againe (<hi>Esai.</hi> 54.7. This is mercie peerels. And yet nothing can moue our hard seared consci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ences to beleeue the Lord to feare him, or to loue him. Thus God deliuered <hi>Israell</hi> out of <hi>Egipt</hi> after 400. yeares miserie. Thus he deliuered them out of the hands of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listim</hi> many times, as we reade in the book of <hi>Iudges.</hi> Thus he deliuered them out of <hi>Babylon</hi> after 70. yeares captiuitie. Thus finally he sent Christ to deliuer them, that sat in darknes, fast bound with the chaines of their sinnes. And since Christ ascended glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20823:101"/>into heauen, the Lord hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Church, first out of that hote perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which lasted almost 300. yeres, and since againe out of the most miserable bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of poperie. Yea euen we were lately deliuered out of a bitter persecution in the dayes of Queene <hi>Marie.</hi> And yet for all this we follow our owne deuises, our good intents, and in euery deede our hartes lust with greater fiercenesse then euer we did, for which cause we haue neede to feare least som destruction be at hande. For the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Gods iudgements are, the more incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible alwayes are the sinnes of men.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we learne here, that they hate the Lord, that do not worship him as he hath commaunded them, but after their owne fantasies, and after the traditions of men. Though they say, yea though they sweare that they loue God; yet their consciences at that day shall conuince them, and God, who is greater then their conscience (1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.20,) plainely telleth them in this place, that they hate him, Wherefore if the Lorde say we hate him it is not our hard heartes, our stiffe neckes, our obstinate minds, our brasen brows that can proue we loue him And let euery soule weigh with himselfe what it is to hate God. For certainly the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20823:102"/>haters of the Lord shalbe found lyars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we learne that he which loueth the Lord in deede, keepeth his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and worshippeth him as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth in his word. Wherefore let euery one that loueth the Lord in truth, be diligent to declare his loue by obeing the voice of the Lord. For this is the loue of God that we keepe his cōmandements 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.3. And the Lord loueth them that loue him <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Quest. <hi>What is the punishment which the magistrate ought to inflict vpon them that transgresse this commaundement in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree and grossest maner?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I suppose it is death, for though I remember not so expresse a commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it as there is for the other eight cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mādemēts (For there is no humane punishmēt appointed for the breakers of the last com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement) yet but that which may be taken out of the word by collection, &amp; these reasons perswade me so to thinke. First the transgressors of the third and fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements are punished with death, and therefore they that breake this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought likewise to be punished with death, seeing this is more generall then they both, so that the offences committed against them, may be reduced within the compasse
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20823:102"/>of this. Secondly the punishment appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the transgressors of the seauen first commaundementes is death, and generally you may obserue this order in all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of both tables, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sinne is first forbid, and the next conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by order and by degrees, wherefore there is no reason to exempt this out of them all, seeing it standeth in the seconde place. Thirdly I take this to be a generall rule, that where no satisfaction can be made, there the punishment is death. Lastly, we see that <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 32.27. by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord, put to death aboute 3000. Idolaters, which were ring-leaders to that Idolatrie in making of the calfe to worship God by, which was most directly against this second commaundement. And for these and such like causes I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the punishment is death. But this you must vnderstand both here, and in the other six first commaundements, that it is not euery particular branch, but the greatest sinne in the hiest degree that falleth vnder the power of the magistrates sword, that he may put him to death, as for example, if a man smite his neighbour and wound him, hauing a purpose to kill him, though this be a greate sinne against the sixt cōmaundement, yet he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20823:103"/>is not to be put to death for it.</p>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> It forbiddeth vs to take the name of God in vaine, wherein we must vnderstād all manner of abusing his name by what meanes soeuer.

And thus one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or person sweareth voluntarily in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter, and of importance, and vpon good occasion. For if a man sweare in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull thing, and rashly, and when there is no cause, he sinneth greatly, as did <hi>Herode Math.</hi> 14. and <hi>Dauid.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25 22. and <hi>Saul.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.10.</p>
            <p>Againe sometime two parties voluntarily consent to sweare each to other, as did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech Gen.</hi> 21.23.24.31.

If otherwise authority compell, and men yeeld to sweare in thinges vnlawfull, and without cause, they both sinne greatly.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The first is when the superiour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or magistrate commaundeth the subiect and the inferiour person to sweare loyalty, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance, &amp; fidelity to performe that which is his duety, as <hi>Abraham</hi> gaue his seruant charge to prouide a wife for his son <hi>Isaake,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him to sweare that he would deale faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and according to the charge giuen him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.3. &amp;c. <hi>Iaacob</hi> also vpon his death bed made <hi>Ioseph</hi> to sweare that he would bury him where his fathers were buried, and not in

The king of <hi>Babel</hi> made <hi>Zedekiah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah</hi> to sweare alleageance to him, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.13. That good king of <hi>Iudah, Asa</hi> made all his subiectes to sweare that they would worship God, 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.10.13.14. Thus the generall of the host taketh an oath of his souldiers.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Quest. <hi>Then if it be lawfull for a man to cleare himselfe of euery crime by his oath, it is to be feared lest many men will make shipwrake of a good conscience and forsweare themselues, if by their oath they may pay their debts, and escape all punishment. This seemes to me a strange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and to giue to to much liberty to euil dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed men. Wherefore I pray you eyther open it more plainely or else proue it by scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> You say well, that if euery offender might purge himselfe by his oath, many great
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:20823:105"/>inconueniences woulde follow. But it is not lawfull for a man in any cause or crime where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he is charged, to cleare himselfe by his oath. For the Lord hath set downe another lawe and an other order for triall of most mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, namely by witnesses, and not by oathes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. <hi>At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be stablished, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore a man may not purge himselfe by his oath in euery thing, but onely in some few speciall cases.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>What be those cases wherein a mans oath may cleare him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> They are as I take it but onely two: the one, when a man deliuereth his neighbour any thing to keepe, and the thing be lost when it should be restored; then if the owner suspect that his neighbour whom he trusted with the keeping of it, hath deceiued him, and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by some meanes conueied it out of his house, and now saith he cannot tell what is become of it, or that it is stollen, then I say, in this case the owner may bring his neighbour before the magistrate, and shew that he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes him of fraud, and the magistrate shall put him to his oath. Which oath if he take and sweare by God that he knoweth not howe it went out of his house, or that it was stollen from him, that his oath shal cleare him, and the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20823:106"/>owner shal accept of his oath, &amp; be therewith content, &amp; so that matter is ended. <hi>Exo.</hi> 22.7.8.</p>
            <p>The other is, when a man deliuereth to his neighbour his beast to keepe for hire, as if a man hire a sheepheard or any other to keepe his beastes, if any of the beastes be hurt, or lost, or stollen, or deuoured by wild beastes, without any fraud or negligence in the keeper, then if the owner suspect the keeper eyther of fraud or negligence, but can proue neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, he may bring him before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. And if the keeper being put to his oath, will sweare that there was neither fraud nor negligence in him, his oath shall cleare him, he shall not make it good, the owner shal beare the losse, as it is, <hi>Exod,</hi> 22.10.11.12.13. And in both these two cases, in which a man may purge himselfe vpon his oath, it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy alwaies to be obserued, that if there be any witnesses to testifie either with them or against them, they are not to purge themselues by oath, but onely when no man can beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as it is expresly said of the latter, <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. <hi>And no man see it.</hi> For when the trueth may be found out by the testimony of men, it is to take Gods name lightly and in vaine, to call him to witnesse. But onely when in these two cases no man can witnesse the innocency of these two persons, or conuince the latter of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20823:106"/>fraude or negligence, or else the former of fraud onely, then is the suspected person per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to cal God to witnes, who onely know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his secrets, and so to purge himselfe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Quest. <hi>Is there then no other case, but these two only, in which a man may purge himself by his oth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Because <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. whatsoeuer is not of faith is sinne, and because for my part I know no moe cases set downe in the word of God, therefore I suppose a man cannot cleare himselfe vpon his oath in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause.

               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, they that curse &amp; sweare at euery word most blasphemously, as by the Lord, by God, by Iesus Christ, &amp;c. or by any thing that is attributed or ascribed to God in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, as by his arme, his head, his hād, his blood his sides, his hart, his flesh, &amp;c. either in earnest or in sport, as though it were a grace to sweare</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, they that commit periury, by swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring falsly, or fraudulently, or that they minde not to performe. <hi>Peter</hi> contrary to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge sware that he knew not Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.72. &amp; <hi>Saul</hi> sware that he minded not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, when he sware to <hi>Ionathan</hi> that he would not kill <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> performed not his oath to the king of <hi>Babel, Ezek.</hi> 17.16.18.19. <hi>Hatto</hi> the archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> cōmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fraudulent periury when he sware to <hi>Adel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Bambarge,</hi> that he

            </p>
            <p>And because men will sweare by Idols and so forsake God, and not suffer reproofe for it, that it may appeare such as feare God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, reproue not vnlawfull oathes of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie or captiousnes, but of conscience and of feare least by silence they should be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof, who so list to reade <hi>Leuit.</hi> 5. in the beginning of the Chapter, shall see that the Lord maks them guilty of an oath, which

            <p>But thus much of taking Gods name in vain by swearing vnlawfully.

            <p>Thirdly, they that haue spirits of diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or south saying, that is to say, familiars in them, as witches, charmers, coniurers, and such like haue, which the Lord forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Leuit. 20.27. And <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10.11. Such as can tel men who haue stolen their horses, or other things: such as can vnwitch children or others that are bewitched, and can tel who bewitched them. And a greate number mo, as stargasers, astrologers, and prognostica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as the prophet <hi>Esaias Chap.</hi> 47.13. calleth them, which can cast figures, tell na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuities, fortunes, and destinies; and are so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently and so profoundly learned in the blacke art as it is called, that nothing comes amisse to hand but they can diuine by it, as by the hand, by fire, by water, by the earth by the aire, by siues or ridles, by flying or crying of birdes. Yea and that the world may see their skilfull vanitie, I meane Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, they can for neede diuine by smoake
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20823:111"/>or by a shadow. Neither doe they take v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to be Lords ouer mens bodies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but they can temper their mindes also at their pleasure. And that which farre sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth all other things, they can tell the destinies and reade the fortunes of shippes, of houses, of cities, as <hi>Tarutias Firmanus</hi> found that Rome was borne in the eclipse of the moone, when <hi>Romulus</hi> laide the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereupon would vndertake to read her destinie, as if the heauens had such a mightie operation in boardes, in timber, in iron, in tiles, brickes, stones, morter, daube, clay, straw, and whatsoeuer. This is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and a rare skill, of which such fooles boast, as though no man knew anithing but they only. Now if a man might haue leaue to pose them, and know the profounditie of their art, he should finde it a painted build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whithout any foundation at all to rest v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, and so hang by the heauens, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi> tombe doth or heretofore did (as the report goeth) hange by the <hi>Loadestone</hi> at <hi>Mecha</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> the stony. And if a man consider either the ground of their art, or the effect of their prognostications, their learning will appear what it is. And first, what demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration can they make of their art? (<hi>I</hi> speake not now of witches &amp;c. but of greate astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20823:111"/>as they would be counted) whence haue they their names of the twelue signes of the zodiake, of fiue of their planets, and of the fixed starres? what is the nature and qualitie of each of them? If al astrologers that heretofore haue liued could not yet for all their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing make so much as one small demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to shew the ground &amp; truth of their art, as learned men haue doone, and dayly doe in all trew liberall arts, it is a token that this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologie is a bastard, and hath no place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong lawfull and trew artes. If the names that be giuen to the starres, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties ascribed to them be childish and ridiculous, or else supersticious and irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as thē selues know, there is no reason why we should beleeue them. The fiue planets <hi>Saturne, Iupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercurie,</hi> whence haue they their names? Are they not called by the names of most wicked, vile, and execrable persons that sometimes liued beastlike vpon the earth, and now for their vilanies are honored as Gods of heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which know not the trew God of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell?</hi> And haue they not such qualities ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to them, as these wicked wretches were of, whose names they beare? If it be demā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded why any of these planets should be of such nature as they affirme, they are at their
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20823:112"/>wittes ende. Likewise for the names and natures of the twelue signes. But it were too tedious to rehearse them, let the astrologer consider them, and how vaine they are. Also for the effectes of their diuinations and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it needeth not to say much. For first of al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though they professe much, yet they are daintie or rather warie of their skil, and in that point shew some wisdome, because they will not easily diuine and prognosticate. Secondly when they doe diuine, they speake obscurely, or doubtfully, or with exception, as hauing guiltie consciences, and fearing for shame to be taken in a lye. And so did <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo, Iupiter Ammon</hi> and others in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, that herein it may appeare whose scholers they are. Thirdly when impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie makes them to diuine in playner speach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es without any ambiguitie, the world is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse what liers they be. <hi>Tully</hi> in his secōd booke <hi>de diuinatione</hi> sayth, that he hearde these wise astrologers prophesie much pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie and many prosperous yeares to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> to <hi>Crassus</hi> and to <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> all which prooued to be false. So many astrological prognostications as haue beene publissed in our dayes are so many witnesses of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoode of diuining astrologie, as sometimes one contrary to another, and yet both false.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The commaundement is short, and my purpose is to ioyne the exposition to it, to make but one speach of both, though I haue seuerally noted the distinct parts. And first note that the Lord comming with authoritie to commaund, doth in this commaundement only say, <hi>Remember,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in all the other he vseth authoririe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely commaundeth. The reasons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be three. 1. First, though all the commaundementes were giuen before, and knowen to the faithful, as partly by the secret worke of God grauen in their nature, and partly giuen by expresse commaundement,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20823:114"/>as for example, the first commaundement was giuen to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. and to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 12.1.2.3. &amp; 17.1. the second was likewise giuen to <hi>Adam,</hi> and accordingly he taught his children to worship God aright, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.3.4. and also <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12.7. the third commaundement is manifestin the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vse of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22.23. and 21.23.24.31: this fourth was giuen. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. the fifth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the sonnes of <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 4. and of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9.22.23. the sixt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. the seauenth appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.3.26.9. in the godly care which <hi>Abraham</hi> had for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mariage of <hi>Isaak, Gen.</hi> 24. and that <hi>Isaak</hi> had for <hi>Iaacob. Gen.</hi> 27.46. &amp; 26.1.6. and in the incest, and iudgement of <hi>Iudah, Gen.</hi> 38.18.24. the eight was well knowen, as we may see, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.19.26.32.37.39. the ninth is manifest in the breach of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.32. &amp; 39.14.17. &amp;c. The tenth being as it were the root from whence the breach of the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements springs, must needs also be know en, though it be so secret a sinne, and so deeply hid in nature that there are no examples of it eyther before or after the law giuen, although there may be some glimse of it in <hi>Iosephs</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.8.9. though all these comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, I say, were giuen before, yet the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> were growen into that obliuion of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20823:114"/>them all in a manner, that the Lord repeating them againe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. speaketh with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and commaundeth as though they had neuer beene giuen, or knowen, or heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and least they should be forgotten againe, putteth them now in writing. But this fourth cōmandement was better kept in memory, &amp; in practise, then any of the rest, and was but a little before repeated, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.22.23.25.26. Therefore the Lord saith now but onely <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mēber,</hi> as if he had said, concerning the saboth you know it verie well, and I gaue you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to obserue it but the other day, therefore see that ye remember it. 2. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as men giuing their sonnes or seruantes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thinges in charge, say of some principall matter, remember this, and though thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get other thinges, yet in any case remember this: so the Lord, to let vs know what recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he maketh of the sabaoth, saith <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabaoth</hi> especially, forget it not. 3. Thirdly, he admonisheth vs of our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse and forgetfulnesse in the best thinges, when he saith <hi>Remember,</hi> as if he said, knowe thine owne slownes and dulnes, and keepe in mind my sabaoth, that thou forget it not.</p>

            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> They had many saboths, ordaies and times of rest: as first euery seauenth day which is heere commanded, and <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.3. then the first day of euery month, as it may be collected out of <hi>Num.</hi> 10.10. &amp; 28.11.14. &amp; 29.6. and as it is manifest, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.3.4. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 3.5. Besides these two sabaoths of daies and moneths, they had euery yeare fiue sabaoths, as first the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, the 14. day of the first moneth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.15. &amp; 13.3. &amp; 23.15. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.5.

               <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Num.</hi> 29.1. the tenth day of the same moneth was a fourth sabaoth, euen the day of reconciliation, wherein they were commanded to fast and reconcile themselues to God, <hi>Lenit.</hi> 23.27. &amp; 16.29. <hi>Exo.</hi> 30.10. <hi>Nu.</hi> 29.7.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There was somthing ceremonial in this commaundement, as the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2.16.17. which was abolished at Christs comming as all other ceremonies were, in so much that <hi>Paul</hi> reproueth the <hi>Galatiās</hi> for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the sabaoth before named, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.10. &amp; that is the cause why we obserue it not now.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>I pray you what was ceremonial in the</hi> 7. <hi>day?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I might giue you a short &amp; ful answer in one word, &amp; say; that wheras al the ceremonies of the Iewes were instituted either for order, or for signification, those which belong to order
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20823:116"/>generally (for such as were for particular order of that time, that place, &amp; those people, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished) do remain &amp; must cōtinually remain for edification &amp; for comely &amp; decent order, as <hi>Paul</hi> would haue al such indifferent things to be ordred. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26.40. and the other signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant ceremonies are abrogated. But because this answer is more general, thē that euery one can make ful vse of, I wil specifie some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which we haue no vse of, neither may haue. Significāt ceremonies in respect of time are threefold, and some are remembrances of things past, some are as it were pictures to set forth things present, and others are types and figures of things to come.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First the saboth was ceremonial, in that it was a remēbrance of the lords rest the seauenth day frō creating any more, &amp; this ceremony is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. For though it is our duties at this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to remēber the power and goodnes of God in creating heauen and earth with all the host of them, &amp; in resting the seuenth day: yet the sabaoth or seuenth day of the week is not appointed to vs at this day to cal that to our remēbrance, but as <hi>Paul</hi> plainly sheweth there was accremony in the seuenth day of the week <hi>Gan.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. so we see the abrogation of it approued by the spirit of God, &amp; the first day of the weeke chosen in steed thereof, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. which is called the lords day, <hi>Apo.</hi> 1.10</p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:20823:116"/>
            <p>Secondly, the sabaoth was ceremonial in that it was a signe &amp; token to teach the <hi>Iewes</hi> that the Lorde did sanctifie them <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Eccle.</hi> 20.20. For when according to Gods commaundement they rested so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from all kinde of ciuill workes that they might not gather <hi>Manna,</hi> nor bake nor boile their meate that day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23.25.26.29. nor kindle a fire <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any necessitie to worke in most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie things, as in the building of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13, or most necessarie times, as in seede-time or in haruest <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.21. which precise rest was full 24. houres, from euen to euen <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.32. When, I say they rested thus precisely from al ciuil labour, they yeelded themselues wholy into the Lords hands, and to his will, that he might worke his will, euen their sanctification. For as the patient standeth, sitteth, or lieth stil as a stone without wagging hand or foote whiles the surgeant or phisician is working vpon him to cure him: so the <hi>Iewes</hi> resting from their owne workes so strictly, gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues without resistance into the handes of God the <hi>Phisician</hi> of their saluation, that he might that day worke vpon them outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his word and such ordinances as he had appointed, and inwardly by his blessed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20823:117"/>Spirit to sanctifie them, for thus the Lorde doth sanctifie his elect, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.17. Now though we be thus sanctified at this day, yet we haue not this vaile of the sabbath to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow it vnto vs, but the shadow being taken away, we haue all things plainely declared to vs without parables.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the verie day itselfe, the seauenth &amp; no other precisely appointed to rest in, and to meditate of heauenly things, was to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that there ought to be one of seauen daies appointed for Gods worship; and to signifie that spirituall rest from sin into which we that beleeue are alreadie entred, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3.10. for in Christ Iesus we haue peace, righteousnes, and life,</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This question seemeth to me so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, that I cannot answere it in one word as I would. For it is a needelesse question in respect of many masters, who are so farre from resting any of the sixe dayes, that they will not rest the seauenth, nor suffer their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uāts or their cattel to rest. Many others do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els sixe dayes, yea and the seauenth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so but rest vpon the alebench at cardes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20823:117"/>dice. Some rest after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in their owne howses all the yere long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuers young gentlemen are brought vp to no other worke and that they ply night and day so earnestly that they haue scarse leasure to sleepe till they haue plaide away the lands and reuenewes which their parents left them. But to touch your question nearer, the Lord that bounde man to perpetuall labour as a punishment for his sinne, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to get his liuing with the sweate of his browes, doth not forbid him to lift vp his eyes to heauen to worshippe his maker. Neither was this commaundement of labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring six dayes giuen before the sabboth or together with it but after it, that whereas man was to serue his creator continually (the earth without labour and toyle yeelding her fruits) and specially the seauenth day, the Lordes meaning in bidding him to worke sixe dayes was to tell him that without his labour the earth would not giue her increase, and not to forbid him to worship God at any time. For the more earnest the people haue bene to serue God, the more hath the earth yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her fruite, and with lesse laboure <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi> 3.10. Also you heard before that the Lord himselfe appointed the <hi>Iewes</hi> diuers sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths besides the seauenth day. And the <hi>Iewes</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:20823:118"/>themselues at diuers times, and for sundry causes rested from ciuil labour, and kept sabbaths to the Lord, as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There is one thing more in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position which may not be omitted, euen this, that the sabbath or day of rest is to the Lord, that is, we may not rest that day to any creature, but only to the Lord. Which I note, first because heathens keepesabbaths to Idols, but specially because of the papists, who imitating the heathen, first consecrated deade men for Gods, as hath beene saide before in the 1. and 2. commaundements, &amp; secondly appointed sabbaths for their new Gods. It is therefore saide in this commā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that our sabbath must be kept ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lord, not to any heathenish or popish Idol.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> No, <hi>I</hi> doe not say so, I wish, and it were greatly to be desired, if it might be, that sabbaths appointed for the Lord were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

But it is a thing not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, except we should keepe no sabbaths to the Lord saue only the Lords day: for the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue made so many new gods as there are dayes in the yere, as you may see in the kalender there is not one spare day. Yea and of later years the Pope hath bene put to his shiftes to get a day for some of his new made Gods: and because he was not able with all his keyes to make one day moe in the yere, he hath beene faine to blot out of the kalender, one of his ould gods, that his new god might put in his foote.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> He saith, thou shalt not doe any work, Where you must note the persons, which are borbidden to labour about any ciuill worke that day. <hi>Thou,</hi> that art a king, a magistrat, afather, a maister, or any other superiour. <hi>Also thy sonne, thy daughter &amp;c.</hi> Where two things are to be obserued: First that there is no libertie graunted more to the superiour then to the inferiour, to the greate then to the smal, to one then to another, but all of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20823:120"/>what state or condition soeuer must sanctifie the Lordes day. Secondly that euery superiour standeth charged before God, not onely for himselfe, but also for those which the Lord hath put vnder his gouernment, that both he and they all sanctifie the Lordes sabaoth or day of rest. Both which lessons are very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be often remembred in these our daies, because some men thinke themselues exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted from keeping the sabaoth, and others thinke they are to care for none but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues onely.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Quest. <hi>Doe you precisely stand vpon the wordes, that we must doe no worke at al that day? There is mention made of a sabaoths daies tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> Act. 1.12. <hi>whereby it seemeth there euer was and now is liberty to doe some thinges that day. What say you to this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> A sabaoths daies iourney was not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from God, but a superstitious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Iewes, which by their traditions prophaned and abused the worde of God as Christ sheweth largly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.21.27.33.38.43 &amp; 15.3. &amp;c. 23.16. &amp;c. But the meaning of the Lord is, that no ciuill worke should be done that day, whereby the godly ciuill pollicie should be violated, the worship of God neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the commuandement of GOD trode vnder foot. For otherwise the Iewes did
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20823:121"/>many thinges vnder the law, and diuers things are lawful for vs that we may do thē. The Iews went to the Temple at Ierusalem that day, or else to their seuerall synagogues, according to their dwellings, some were further off, and some were nearer, but none brake the sabaoth in going to the ordinarie place of the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, though he dwelt two or three howers iourney off. For they counted the distance of places more by their iournies, then by miles or such other measures. The priestes and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites were occupied that day busilie in killing, dressing, washing, burning of the sacrifices with incense, and such other exercises as belonged to the sabaoth. The people they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so brought their cattell that day to Ierusalem to be sacrificed with such other thinges as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed thereto, and yet brake not this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Wherefore this may be set down for a generall rule both vnder the Lawe and vnder the Gospell, that workes of pietie &amp; religion in Gods worship all are lawfull to be done, yea necessarie that they must be done vpon the sabaoth daie. Furthermore, vnto this I will adde two other generall rules, of which this is the first. That is lawfull to be done vpon the Lordes sabaoth, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie vrgeth and compelleth men to doe. As for example, the Apostles constrained
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20823:121"/>with hunger plucked the eares of corne rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed them in their handes, and did eate the corne vpon the day of rest, and yet pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the sabaoth, for Christ defendeth their doing to be lawfull, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.3. &amp;c. <hi>Marke.</hi> 2.27. And who is he that will not drawe his sheepe that day out of a ditch, to saue it? And much more is mans life to be preserued. The second generall rule is this. Whatsoeuer cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie doeth specially require and presently, that may be done vpon the day of rest without breach of this commandement, as Christ hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him that had the withered hand vpon the sabaoth day, <hi>Math,</hi> 12.10.11. and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that had beene bowed together eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, <hi>Luke.</hi> 13.12. and said it was as much charitie to loose her from Satans bonds on the sabaoth, as to loose an oxe from the stalle and leade him to the water. For the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth was made for man, and not man for the sabaoth, <hi>Marke.</hi> 2.27. Wherefore whatsoeuer religion commandeth, or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie vrgeth, or charity craueth that day, the same may &amp; must be done vpon the sabaoth. Then to visite the sicke, or others in destresse, to comfort them, to make their beds, to cure them, and diuers such charitable and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie workes may that day be done, yet so that neither godly pollicy and order be violated,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20823:122"/>nor Gods worship neglected.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> Quest. <hi>I pray you shew me then who they are that breake this commandement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There are so many that I cannot reckon the hundreth part of them, yet I will name a few; as, First, they that would bring vs backe againe to the beggerly ceremonies of the olde law, which are abolished, and would haue vs to keep the Iewes sabaoth. The <hi>Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onites</hi> obserue it, <hi>Euseb. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers after them in so much that the counsell of <hi>Laodicea, Can.</hi> 29. forbad it more then 300. yeares after Christ. And at this day some men curiously trouble themselues and others about it. Contrariwise they who woulde haue no saboath or day of rest at all, but say all daies are alike sabaothes. For though one day be no better then another, yet there is and euer hath beene, by the Lordes appointment, one speciall day of seauen for the publike worship of God, which we also ought religiously to keepe holy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, they that forsake the assembly of the congregation that day, as too too many do. Some find fault with the ministery &amp; ministers as if they were not of God: others haue no tast at all of the goodnes of the word of God, and therefore carelesly contemne the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; lie in their beds, or sit idle, or are occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20823:122"/>in their own affaires, or walk into the fields for recreation, or go looke to their ground and to their cattell, or spend the time at cardes and dice and drinking in the alehouse, or runne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plaies, pipings, dancings, or other points of sinfull felowship with a greate number moe which that day aboue all other daies in the weeke follow hard after great sinnes and that with greedinesse. And these ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, if vpon due admonishment they amend not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of them that come to the Church, it woulde make a godly Christians heart to bleede, to see the dishonor that is done to God that day, and to tremble for feare of the iudgements that hang ouer their heades for such disobedieuce and misdemeanor in Gods presence, that he may say with <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>vers.</hi> 53. <hi>Feare is come vpon me for the wicked, that forsake thy lawe,</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 136. <hi>Mine eies gush out with riuers of water, because the keepe not thy lawe.</hi> For some come so late and goe away againe so soone, that it is all one as if they had not beene there.
<note place="margin">Some come of custome.</note> Some behaue themselues so vnreuerentlie as if they came to the market, or rather as if they came among some idle companie where they might take a nappe, seeing that for worldlie cares which runne in their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20823:123"/>heades, they could not sleepe of all the last nightlong. Some come for fashion and sit like sottes, and ve haue no more of them but onely their bodily presence, they cannot tell what was said, or what they did there, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they went for company.
<note place="margin">Other to shew their pride.</note> Some come to shew themselues in their braue apparrell, in their proud lookes, in their loftie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in their stately going, in their trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and mincing after the same manner that <hi>Esaias</hi> the Prophet speaketh of <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. &amp;c. And if their wanton eyes, their hautie lookes, with all their pride and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie be noted of others and talked of at dinner, O then it is well with them, then they haue their desire, euen the thing for which they went to the Church, then are the merrie and glad.
<note place="margin">Others to intrappe the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> Some come to the Church, as the Scribes and Pharisies came to heare Christ, to marke the minister that they may intangle him in his words, to watch whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he weare the surplus or not; if he doe weare it, some will not heare but goe away againe presently, againe if he doe not weare it, other will not heare him. And so the minister is watched on each hande, and had neede to desire wisedome of the Lord to walke holily in the middest of such a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward generation. Some come to heare
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20823:123"/>some strange doctrine, that is, some strange newes, (as if it were at <hi>Venice,</hi> which Citie is now giuen to heare nothing but newes, as sometimes <hi>Athens</hi> was, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.21.) and if they heare nothing but Iesus Christ purely &amp; plainely preached, and such holy and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some words as they haue heard before, they thinke they haue lost their labour. And these men are more puffed vp with an ambitious desire of bare knowledge, then inwardely touched with any zeale, feeling, or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minde.
<note place="margin">Some com for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> Some looke that the preacher shoulde tickle their itching eares with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent oration, and care not to haue their soules cured, which are grieuously wounded with many grosse sinnes. Some that come are such as the Prophet <hi>Hoseas</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Thy people are as they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the priest.</hi> For one saith the minister wantes learning; an other saith he wantes vtterance, and hath no grace at all in his speach; an other saith hee vtters manie wordes but no matter; an other saith he is a flatterer and hath no conscience; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sayeth hee is so zealous that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettes himselfe, or is halfe madde as <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Actes.</hi> 26.24. another saith hee speakes of the splene, and of malice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth mee. And all these knowe not, nay
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20823:124"/>they will not knowe that there are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of giftes, but the same spirite which distributeth to euerie man seuerally as he will, and that no man can say that Iesus is the Lorde but by the holie Ghost, 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 12.3.4.11. Neyther doe they knowe that they themselues are like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren sitting in the markets, which call vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their fellowes, and say, <hi>We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not daunced; we haue mourned vnto you, and ye haue not lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Math.</hi> 11.17. Some come to the Church but they hate <hi>Micheah,</hi> and heare him with ill will,

Some will come in the forenoone, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thinke they haue pleasured God as greatly as if they had done some popish supererogant worke, but in the afternoone they will make themselues a dispensation though they neuer come at the Pope for it, and goe a spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or sit at Cardes and Tables or such like exercise.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:20823:125"/>to be excommunicated. Some go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of housheholdes come themselues to the Church, but they let their families, sons, daughters and seruants runne at random which way they will, or else send them about worldly busines.

And if a man would enter further into this matter, he should finde moe abhominations. Now seeing there are so many vnprofitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers to the Church, besides them that heare the word, but follow it not, and whome Christ compareth to him that builds his house vpon the sande <hi>Math.</hi> 7.26. it is not like the number should be greate of those which sincerely keepe and sanctifie the Lords sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath aright. And among many other causes of Gods wrath, this is not the least, whie these diuers yeares past for eight or ten the Lord hath sent euery yere a new and strange kind of sickenesse, such as neither we nor our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers haue knowen, and why in the yere 1593. the Lord sent such a terrible plague and pestilence as amazed all, and slew many, &amp;

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Many things are spoken in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which seeme strange vnto vs, because we consider not well the occasion, nor the drift of the holy Ghost. Christ reprouing the ambition of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisies,</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Apostles to be humble and lowlie minded, not loftie and proude: for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he giueth them this generall admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>vers.</hi> 8. and saith, <hi>yee are all brethren.</hi> If any father haue a greate familie and many children, and make one of his sons his stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arde, another his clarke or secretarie, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his bailife &amp;c. one to ouersee things in the house, another to take charge of thinges abroade: it beseemeth not the sonnes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all brethren and so farre equall, to take vpon them one to crow ouer another, one to commaund an other imperiously, to looke for greate reuerence one of another; but that euerie one doe his office faithfully, and help one another as brethren, and in giuing honour (not in claiming ambition) to goe one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20823:128"/>another (<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10.16.) So saith Christ, ye are all brethren, and haue al one father, as it is written, <hi>Esai</hi> 64.8. <hi>O Lord, thou art our father: we are the clay, and thou art ourpotter, and we all are the worke of thine hands.</hi> and Malach. 2.10. <hi>Haue we not all one father? hath not one God made vs?</hi> as if Christ had saide, though you haue diuers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and callings, yet you haue all one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen God, and all our teacher, euen Christ: therefore affect not ambitiously titles of honour as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisies</hi> do, but diligently performe the duties of your calling with humility. And thus you see there is no repugnancie in the scriptures. For though the Lord hathe made one man father, and another sonne, yet God is father to them both, in which respect they are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren both by creation and by addoption. And though one man be maister or Doctor and another disciple and scholer, yet Christ is Doctor, maister, and teacher to them both, as it is <hi>Math.</hi> 17.5, <hi>Heare him.</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that rare &amp; excellent man of God <hi>M. Caluin</hi> hath most plainly expoūded the plac, saying, that maistershippe or fathershippe is not forbidden by Christ, which neither violateth brotherly fellowship, nor disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth God. But if any man wil lifte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20823:128"/>so hie as to chalenge the name of Father in such sort that he doe not plainely professe and shew by worde and deed that God is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vs all, and so moderate his fathership that he also she we his selfe a brother euen to them ouer whom he is a father by the Lords appointment: and if a doctor, master, or tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher so swell with pride of his calling, that he doe not manifestly declare himselfe also to be but a fellow disciple, &amp; that Christ is our only chiefe teacher: if I say, eyther father or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thus ambitiously dishonor God our father or Christ our schole-master and shew not him selfe to be a brother, and a felow-disciple, he offendeth. And it is his pride which Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth. For authoritie is giuen to men to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God withall, not to dishonour him: and to maintaine brotherly fellowship, not to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Lorde that hath giuen vs that commaundement to obey our superiours, hath rendred a reason also why they ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed. For as all honour and all obedience is due to God without any exception: so hath he most gratiously commaunded some of his owne honour and glorie to superiours, as if he had put some of his owne royall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes vpon them, thereby to cause vs to honour them, as for example; although the Lorde be God alone, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.35. yet this
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:20823:130"/>glorie hath he commuicated so farre to kings and magistrates that he calleth them Gods, because they are his vicegerentes, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine his person in certaine causes, as you may reade, <hi>Exodus.</hi> 21.6. <hi>and</hi> 22.8.9. <hi>and Psalm.</hi> 82. And albeit we haue but one teacher or master, euen Christ, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.8. yet the Lorde hath put so much glory v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ministers of his word as to call them our doctors or teachers, because as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sente Christ, so Christ sente them, (<hi>Iohn.</hi> 20.21.) with the worde of reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation as ambassadours to intreate men to be reconciled to GOD, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.20. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God onely be our father, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.6. our onely creator and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker as <hi>Esaias</hi> sheweth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 64.8. neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he hath imparted this glorie to our naturall parentes, that they are called our fathers, because he hath giuen them this power &amp; appointed them to begette vs. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that Christ alone is the onely heade of his Church and of euerie member there of, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.22. yet this honour is giuen to the husband, that hee is called his wiues heade, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.23. because he is to loue and cherish his wife, as Christ loued his Church. Whereby you may see first that obedience is to be giuen to all
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:20823:130"/>superiours, and secondly that all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not to be giuen to all superiours, but onely to euery one that obedience, which the glorie, that GOD hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to each of them, requireth. And for this cause we giue one obedience to the magistrate, and an other to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and an other to the master, and an other to naturall parentes, and eache wife an other to her owne husbande. Nowe whatsoeuer any superiour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth according to the glorie which the Lorde hath put vpon him, that ought the inferiour to obey and doe. But if any superiour will extende his authoritie aboue the glorie receiued, he ought not to be obeyed in that thing. As for example, if the magistrate commaunde a subiect to giue him that honour which a wife oweth to her husband, and in all thinges to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him as a wife doth her husbande, the subiect is not bound, neyther ought to giue that obedience to the magistrate. And that which is manifest, and so cleare in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that no man can or will for shame denie, the same may be saide of the rest. For the authoritie of euerie superiour is finite and limited within certaine boundes and listes according to the measure and qualitie of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:20823:131"/>glory which the Lorde hath communicated vnto him, and he ought not to go beyond that. For it is God alone who hath al authority ouer all without limitation or exception. And if any superiour doe go beyond his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, yet the inferiour ought not therein to obey him.</p>
            <p>And for this cause, when the Lorde commaundeth inferiours to obey their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, he doth now &amp; then admonish them how farre they ought to obey. As when he biddeth the subiest obey the king, be saith in the booke of the preacher, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>vers.</hi> 2. I aduertise thee <hi>to keepe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the king but according to the oath of GOD.</hi> That is, with this limitation, or exception, that thou breake not the oath which thou hast sworne to God. For if the king commaunde thee to breake any of Gods commaundementes, to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping whereof thou hast bound thy selfe by an oath, thou must not obey him. So Christ saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Giue to Caesar the thinges that are Caesars; and giue vnto God those thinges which are Gods.</hi> So <hi>Paule</hi> wisheth men to obey magistrates <hi>for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, Rom.</hi> 13.5. No we hee that obeieth further then GOD commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, he doth it not for conscience sake,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20823:131"/>but against his conscience, because it is the Lorde onely that bindeth the conscience. And for this cause <hi>Daniell</hi> and his fellowes refused to obey the kings commaundement <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. &amp; 6. and the Apostles would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the commaundement, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistorie of the Iewes enioyned them, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19.</p>
            <p>Also when Commaundement is giuen to obey the ministers of the worde, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. this clause or caueat is annexeth, <hi>that standeth before the Lorde thy God to minister there,</hi> as if he had saide, so long and so farre as he executeth his office before the Lorde. The same Christ teacheth vs, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. that whiles the scribes sit in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> seate, all that which they command out of the worde of God, is to be obeyed. The same admonition doth the Apostle giue, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.12. <hi>&amp; Heb.</hi> 13.17. Concerning children it is saide, <hi>Ephesians.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Children obey your parentes in the Lorde,</hi> but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            </p>
            <p>And reason teacheth vs howe equall these exceptions be. For it is a generall axiome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20823:132"/>the learned, that <hi>Lex inferioris non praeiudicat nec derogat legi superioris,</hi> the lawe of the inferiour is not preiudicall too, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diminishieth any thing from the lawe of the superiour.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Quest. <hi>What is the reason of this commaundement: and howe doe parentes prolonge the daies of their children vpon earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason I take to be this, that as before the lawe, naturall parentes and gouernours of greate families had power to put to death such as within their house deserued it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.24. so after the lawe giuen at <hi>Horeb,</hi> that authoritie and more also was committed to certaine men of Israell chosen to be magistrates. And if any naturall sonne disobeyed his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, hee was brought before the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate and put to death, <hi>Deutro.</hi> 21.21. Likewise all inferiours were to be punished by the magistrate according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their trespasse, if they disobeyed their superiours. Wherefore seeing God hath giuen authoritie to magistrates to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish offenders, and to put them to death if their offence deserue it; and also made the magistrate a protector and defendor of them that doe well, as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:20823:132"/>1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3.4. <hi>Deutro.</hi> 1.16.17. the Lord in this commaundement chargeth inferiours to obey their suppriours and in so doing they shalbe defended &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by their superiours from wrongs and from iniuries, and so haue their liues and their dayes prolonged vpon earth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise if they disobeye their superiours, they haue authoritie to cut them off, and shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Quest. <hi>Why doth Paul say this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the first with promise? had not the second a promise added to it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> That which is added to the second commaundement is rather a declaration of the iustice and mercie of God, then any promise. But whereas God hath made many promises and greate to them that keepe his commaundements and specially <hi>Leuit</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28 of all those promises he hath not annexed any one to any of al the ten commaundements, when he gaue them in <hi>Sinai,</hi> saue only this one promise, and that to this fift commaundement only, and so it is both the first, and also the last commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which hath any of all those promises annexed vnto it. For otherwise this promise perteineth to them that keepe the other commaundementes, as it is manifest, <hi>Deut.</hi>

            <p>Quest. <hi>Now that you haue shewed me the meaning of the Lord in this commaundement, I pray you declare who breake it, that so we may haue more vse of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> First they that rebell against kings, princes, and magistrates, as did <hi>Dathau</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> the sonnes of <hi>Renben</hi> against <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Num.</hi> 16. as did <hi>sheba</hi> the sonne of <hi>Bichri</hi> against <hi>Dauid</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.1. as did <hi>Iozacar</hi> and <hi>Iehosabad</hi> against <hi>Ioash</hi> king <hi>of Ierusalem</hi> 2. <hi>king</hi> 12.21. as the seruants did against <hi>Amaziah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah.</hi> 2. <hi>king.</hi> 14.19. but are threatned with Gods Iudgements for their rebellion <hi>Mich.</hi> 1.13. And by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were foure kings of <hi>Israel</hi> slaine within the space of 34. yeares, as we reade 2. <hi>king.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they that murmur against their princes and magistrates, and finde fault with paying of tribute, not considering that they, their wiues, their children, and al that they haue are preserued in safetie and peace, by the care, wisdom, and prouidence of their prince. Thus the subiectes in <hi>Salomons</hi> dayes murmured, as it appeareth 1. <hi>king</hi> 12.4. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Salomon</hi> made siluer in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as plentifull as stones 1. <hi>king.</hi> 10.27. And vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon such sinfull murmuring, follow euil words
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:20823:133"/>and railing speaches contrarie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Iob.</hi> 34.18. Thus <hi>Shemei</hi> railed on <hi>Dauid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, they that fauour and maintaine triators or mall-content mutinous subiectes giuing them countenance or enterteinement. And such be they that harbour our closse pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and disguised traitours the hipocriticall <hi>Iesuites,</hi> which are the vipers of England, and will eate out the bellie of England, to let the Pope, the instument of the redde dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, come in againe, except their fosterers may be well looked vnto, and receiue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their wicked desertes. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in England loueth hartely the Lords annointed our most gratious Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> that hath made siluer as plenteous as stones in England (for what childe, seruant, or begger hath not siluer in his purse at this day) and through the Lords blessing also hath made such deepe-peace, and roial prosperitie within the walles of England as neuer was in any nation since <hi>Salomons</hi> dayes; that I may spare to speake of the vnspeakable treasure of the gospel, whosoeuer I say, loueth his dreade Souereigne truly, detesteth these po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish <hi>Iesuits</hi> and all poperie, as aduersaries to Christ, to the gospell, and to all Christian princes, and thereunto desire their fauorites
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:20823:134"/>may be well looked into. For their malice is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospell of Iesus Christ and against al the mighty mainteiners of it. And if the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light of the gospell should euer hereafter be quenched in Engand, how shall we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures in this world, which is full of darkenes, finde the way to heauen, how shal our posteritie and successors corn to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea and how greately shall God be dishonored, when papists, atheists &amp; heathens throughout the world (for they haue al heard what greate things the Lord hath doone for England) shall say, where is now the God of England? what is now become of the gospell of Christ that was so plentifully preached in England? O that this were well considered of all that feare God. For my part, it is greater then I am able to expresse. The Lord for his owne glorious names sake shew mercie to England, and be good to them that shall come after vs, that our grape-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set not posterities teeth on edge as the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> children did beare the iniquities of their faithers almost fortie yeares in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes <hi>Num.</hi> 24.33. and that tollerated pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists be not prickes in the eyes, nor thorns in the sides of our posteritie.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie they doe not faithfully execute their office committed to them by the prince,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:20823:134"/>whether they haue office in the Church or the common wealth, but turne iudgement into gall and righteousnes into wormewood <hi>Amos</hi> 5.7. &amp; 6.12. but bite with their teeth, and cry peace, but if a man put not into their mouthes they prepare warre against him <hi>Mich.</hi> 3.5. For as the kings throne is stablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by iustice and mercie <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.12. &amp; 20.8.28. So for want of due execution it is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. And where there is no vision, the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple decay <hi>Pro.</hi> 29.18. Wherefore seing these two, adminstration of iustice, &amp; sincere preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing of the word at two chief pillers to support a kings throne, &amp; the Lord chargeth the kings to see both these duly performed, they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the king in these two, are meanes to pul downe his throne.</p>
            <p>Also those that obey not the ministers of the worde of God, when faithfully they preach the gospell and deuide the word a right, they oftend against this commaundement, and are causes of greate wrath from the Lord, and of much calamitie among men. For as the Lord commaunded <hi>Ioshua</hi> to stand before <hi>Eleazar</hi> the priest, who should aske counsel of the Lord for him <hi>Num,</hi> 27.21. and as <hi>Dauid</hi> accordingly did in al his actions aske counsell of the Lord by the priestes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.15. &amp; 23.2.4.6. And as
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20823:135"/>
               <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> prospered whiles he sought the Lord. 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.3.4.5. and as <hi>Ioash</hi> did that was right in the sight of the Lord al the time that <hi>Iehoiada</hi> the priest taught him 2. <hi>kings</hi> 12, 2, as did also <hi>Ʋzziah</hi> King of <hi>Iuda</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Zechariah</hi> that instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the feare of the Lord 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.5. so they that haue not obeyed the word of the Lord declared to them by his ministers, haue purchased many miseries, as the prophet of the Lord tould <hi>Amaziah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah.</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 25.16. <hi>I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast doone this</hi> (that is; serued idols <hi>Vers.</hi> 14.) <hi>and hast not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> my <hi>counsell.</hi> for he counselled the kinge to forsake his Idolatrie. For it is a general rule &amp; a truth grounded vpon the law of god <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26.21.24. and 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.27. which <hi>Azariah</hi> the prophet tould <hi>Asa</hi> that good king of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.2. saying, <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him: and if yee seeke him; he wilbe found of you, but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</hi> And which <hi>Sema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> the prophet tould <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 12.1.2.5. <hi>ye haue forsaken me</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>therefore haue</hi> I <hi>left you in the handes of Shishak.</hi> And <hi>Abiah</hi> king of <hi>Iudah,</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and all <hi>Israel</hi> 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 13.9. for the same cause. In the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:20823:135"/>we reade not of one good King that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the feare of God, and therefore they were depriued of the tokens and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Gods fauour 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 15.3. And also oppressed with many calamities <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.15. and at the last were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroied for being a kingdome. Likewise the chiefe cause of the destruction of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> when he went into captiuitie, was because they would not obey the priestes &amp; prophets of the Lord, as <hi>Ieremie</hi> witnesseth <hi>Chap.</hi> 35.15.16.17. and that also was the cause of their reiection at Christes comming <hi>Math.</hi> 23.37.38.39. This also is the cause whie the seauen famous Churches in <hi>Asia</hi> haue their candlestickes remoued from them. This is the cause of the miseries of <hi>Germany, Fraunce,</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> And except there be more obedience giuen to the word of God among vs, then I can perceiue there is, we may daily looke for some greate iudgment from God. We had neede dayly to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the comparison the Apostle vseth <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2.3. where he sheweth that if the disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Law giuen by Angels, were sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished, much more shall they be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished which obediently receiue not such grace as now is offred in the gospell. The Lord of mercie open our eyes that we may
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20823:136"/>see it; and mollifie our stonie hearts, that we may vnfainedly repent, and renew the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of our God, and so repent his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Now if I should come to particular states &amp; degrees of men, or to particular sinnes, to shew how that which the ministers of the word preach in the name and in the wordes of the Lord, is disobeyed; I should be too too tedious, although I haue alreadie ouershot my selfe, as hauing purposed but only to haue pointed with the finger to the capitall heads of things, whose braunches are more fully declared by daily preaching, then I am able to come nere vnto by writing, seuerall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions mouing the Spirit by which they speake, to touch particulars most notably. What person so mean or so base throughout al the Land almost, that doth not despise the minister and the word he preacheth, as their workes declare? what man followeth no this fantasie? Let the minister preach neuer so much, he will doe what he list, and thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all is well if he doe not such open vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as the lawes of the Land will punish. what couetous Idolaters, what cruel oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, what vncleane persons, what deceitfull traders, what cunning iugglers in all dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, what falshood in fellowship, what co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20823:136"/>in bargaining, what merciles misers, what discontented murruurers, what virulent hatred, what bloodie murders, that bloode toucheth blood? that a man might heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rehearse the sixt verse of the first chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Esaias.</hi> And yet for all this, who can say that such a man pricked in his soule with remorse of conscience for his sinnes, or else terrified with the iudgementes of God, hath giuen any notable testimonie of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance before he durst presume to come to the Lordes table? nay diuers commaunded to testifie their repentance because their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were publike, doe shift it off, beeing more ashamed of mens faces, then afraide of Gods iudgements. And where then is the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience giuen to the ministers of the worde of God? <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prou.</hi> 30.12. <hi>There is a generation that are pure in their owne conceit, and yet are not washed from their filthines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, children that disobey their parents,
<note place="margin">They that disobey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</note> and mocke them, as <hi>Ham</hi> did his father <hi>Noe, Gen.</hi> 9.22. of whome thus speaketh the holy Ghost, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30.17. <hi>The eye that mocketh his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, &amp; despiseth the instruction of his mother, let the rauens of the valley picke it out, and the yong eagles eate it.</hi> They that make mariages for themselues without their parentes knowledge, liking, and consent contrary to the law of God.

               <hi>Ex.</hi> 22.16.17. So did <hi>Esau, Ge.</hi> 26.34.35.27.46. They that by dissention, and by their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes grieue their parents, as <hi>lacobs</hi> sonnes did when they solde <hi>Ioseph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt, Gen.</hi> 37.33.34.35. and when they guilefully slew the <hi>Sechemites, Gen.</hi> 34.30.

They that steale any thing from their parents, as <hi>Michah</hi> did from his mother, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 17.1.2.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,
<note place="margin">Wiues that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their husbands.</note> wiues that are not obedient to their husbandes as they ought to be, but eyther for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the guide of their youth, &amp; forget the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of their God, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2.17. &amp; with harlots be hauiour and subtile hearts, are alwaies bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, sometime within, sometimes without, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in waite at euery corner to entice young

But if good &amp; religious wiues woulde learn their duties, &amp; how they ought to be haue thēselues let them read, <hi>Pr.</hi> 31.10. 1. <hi>Pe.</hi> 3.1. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Lastly,
<note place="margin">Seruants that diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their masters.</note> seruants breake this commandement when they are idle loiterers, and not painefull labourers; that looke for all their wages, but make no conscience to neglect their seruice; that wil work til they sweat when their master is present, but loiter so soone as he hath turned his back til they catch a cold with being idle. They that despise their masters which are igno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rant of the misteries of saluation, &amp; thinke it is no matter before God if they loiter when they haue such masters, not regarding that they cause their ignorant masters to speake euill of their God, of their faith, and of their religion. But these seruants may learne what <hi>Paul</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:20823:138"/>them, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. Others whose masters haue knowledge and beleeue in God, they likewise grudge and mutter, saying, they are as good as their master, they are his brethren, and that God accepteth no persons. But these seruants consider not the Lords appointment, who could haue made the seruant a master, the subiect a king, the sonne to be the father, the yonger to be the elder, if it had pleased him: but seeing the Lord hath disposed of all men for the affairs of this life, let euery man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his calling &amp; therein abide with God 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24. And let these seruants read <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. Others neglect their seruice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their masters are too too hard and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous without cause, as though a seruant might doe euill for euill. But let these seruants reade, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. Also those seruants breake this commandement, which serue their masters as <hi>Ziba</hi> serued <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1.2.3. &amp; 19.24.25. Other seruants when a man bringeth their master a present, or a bribe to obtaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull fauour in an eull matter, if the master refuse it because he will not be corrupted, then they wil receiue something secretly, promising to do their best to corrupt their master. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time where the master is a good man and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing of his tenants but his rentes, the seruant wil goe in his masters name (but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:20823:138"/>his masters knowledge) for something &amp; keepe it to himself, as if it were <hi>Gehesie,</hi> 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 5.20.27. Somtime when the master maketh the seruant his pursebearer, and biddeth him giue a shilling to a poore man, the seruant much like <hi>Iudas</hi> will giue the poore man sixe pence &amp; put the restin his own purse. Somtime the seruant put in trust to sel his masters goods in the shop, in the fayre, in the market, in the marte, will alwaies be purloyning some to himselfe, whereby some masters are shortly consumed, and the wicked seruant by his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Mammon</hi> inriched. Some seruants make a couenant with theeues, and so rob their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Some seruants get great summes of their masters money into their handes, and runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with it. Some betray their masters sonnes and daughters, to lewd company, or to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Some do many thinges in their masters names, whereof their masters are ignorant. And there is neither siluer nor golde, nor any other thing so rare to he had at this day, as it is to finde a good and faithfull seruant.</p>
            <p>How little reuerence youth giueth to age,
<note place="margin">Youth dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>obeyeth age.</note> is a thing more manifest to the eye of the world then that there needes any wordes to be spent about it. It were rather to be wished that they which are in authority would redresse it by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment laid open euery boy that hauing but a
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:20823:139"/>feather in his hat, or a poinado at his girdle, or a short cloake on his backe, or twelue pence in his purse, will iustle with euery man that giues him not the way, will saucely crow o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer auncient gray-headed fathers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously abuse all ages &amp; degrees, whom they stand not in awe of.

            <p>And besides these examples there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall doctrine <hi>Leuit</hi> 2.4.5. that if the people of the land (that is, the magistrates especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) winke at sinne, will not see it, and so suffer it to goe vnpunished, then the Lorde will set his angry countenance not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the sinner, but also against the people of the land. A notable spectacle of this doctrine is <hi>Ioshu:</hi> 22.18. When the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites, Gadites, and halfe of the tribe of <hi>Manasses</hi> had built an alter on the south side of <hi>Iordan</hi> for a memoriall to their posteritie, that it might be knowen they were <hi>Israelites.</hi> But when the <hi>Israelites</hi> inhabiting within the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> heard that their brethren had made an alter, they supposing it had bene for Idolatrie, and therefore were afraide of Gods iudgements, and sent messengers ouer <hi>Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> to their brethren saying, <hi>Seeing ye rebel to day against the Lord, euen to morrow he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bewrath with all the congregation of Israel,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>knowledging that if they should suffer sinne vnpunished, the Lords wrath would burst out against them all, as the place euidently shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:20823:142"/>Yea if sinne be secretly committed, and kept close from the knowledge of the magistrate, yet the Lord wilbe angry with the whole land, as it appeareth in the example of <hi>Achan Iosh.</hi> 7. For though he only sinned secretly, yet the army of <hi>Israel</hi> was put to flight for his offence, &amp; 36. men of <hi>Israel</hi> were slaine. The same is manifest <hi>Deut.</hi> 21 in that the magistrates must in such sort protest their innocencie, and so purge the citie from blood guiltines, when a man is found slaine in the field, and the murderer is not knowen. When <hi>Isaac</hi> soiourning in <hi>Gerar</hi> saide of <hi>Rebecca</hi> that she was his sister, <hi>Abimelech</hi> a heathen king afterward percieuing that she was his wife, called <hi>Isaac</hi> vnto him, &amp; reprouing him for it, said, <hi>one of the people had almost lien by thy wife, so shouldest thou haue brought sin vpon vs Gen.</hi> 26.10. he doth not say, so shouldest thou haue brought sinne vpon him that had lien with thy wife only, but he saith, <hi>vpon vs,</hi> shewing that if sinne be committed, the wrath of the Lord wilbe against the whole land, and specially against them, to whom God hath giuen authoritie to punish it. Also vpon like occasion <hi>Abimelech</hi> had said before to <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 20.9, <hi>what haue I offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom this greate sinne?</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The diuers kindes of murdering the bodie are so commonly knowen by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience, that I shall not neede to stand vpon it. But in one worde or two thus much. If the murderer be not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, but a mans life is taken away and no man can tell who shed that bloode, then all the Citie, towne, vilage, or parish where such murder is secretly committed is guiltie of that mans bloode that is slaine, but specially the magistrates and chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of that place, because they kept not better watch and warde for mens safetie, but through some negligence of theirs let a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:20823:145"/>mans blood be shed, and the murderer to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape and not be knowen. For as we haue a most commendable order for the safetie of mens goods, that if the Citie, towne, village, or parish next to the place where any man is robbed, doe not vpon the complaint of the man that is robbed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the theeues and robbers to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende them, then that Citie, towne, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, or parish seemeth to be priuie to the robberie, and for their negligence are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to the man robbed all that he lost: so the Lorde hath made a most holie and necessarie lawe, <hi>Deutro.</hi> 21. that when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man is murdered and the murderer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen, then the elders or gouernours of that place shoulde in a solemne manner and with such ceremonies as the Lord there prescribeth, first protest that they were not priuie to that murder, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by prayer to intreate the Lorde not to lay that murder to their charge, <hi>verse.</hi> 8. Of which lawe though the ceremonies be abolished, yet the equitie remaineth, that magistrates should haue speciall care for to preserue mens liues, and knowe that if through their negligence murder be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or after it is committed, the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer winked at and suffered to escape, they
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:20823:145"/>cannot be innocent before GOD. For if that order for safetie of mens goods be commendable and necessarie, a thousande soulde more holy and more necessarie is this law of God, which is for safetie of mens liues.</p>
            <p>But to come to other kindes of murders where the murderer is knowen, sometimes a man is his owne murderer and killeth himselfe, as <hi>Saul</hi> and his harnest-bearer fell vpon their owne swordes and died, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.4. <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophell</hi> hanged himselfe, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.23. <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> set his owne pallace on fire and burnt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, 1. <hi>King.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Iudas</hi> the traitour han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himselfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 1.18. The <hi>Donatistes</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> killed themselues when they should haue beene apprehended, and haue suffered iust punishment for their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies; and some of them, whom <hi>Philastrius</hi> calleth circuitores, caused those they met in the way to kill them, and said they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of martyrdome. For they termed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues martyrs when they murdered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. The cause which moueth any man to kill himselfe is commonly eyther despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or else impatiencie. For some men thinking that nothing goes well with them except they may obtaine that they desire, whatsoeuer it be when they cannot haue it,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:20823:146"/>and begin to despaire to obtaine it, then they kill themselues.

            <p>

            <p>I willset downe two or three reasons to diswade men from murder.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the Lord the greate king of all the world forbiddeth it in this commaundement, and therefore al men ought to consider dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently of all their wayes, for they must giue an account to God of all their actions.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, because man is the image of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:20823:149"/>God, therefore men ought to be afraide of shedding mans blood, as the Lord himselfe doth admonish vs by this same reason <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, we haue all one father, and are brethren, and our neighboure is of our flesh as the prophet <hi>Esaias</hi> speaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 58.7. For which cause we ought to absteine from murdering of our brethren, as from hurting our owne flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we pollute the Land, euen the whole citie, or towne, or parish or place where we shed blood, and so make a greate mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude gulitie, and subiect to Gods fearefull plagues, as was shewed before out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. <hi>for blood defileth the Land: and the Land cannot be clensed of the blood that is shed therin, but by the blood of him that shed it</hi> Numbers 35.33.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, he that killeth a man, is the cause also of his owne death, for the magistrate is commaunded of God to put him to death that committeth murder, wherefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his owne life, if he regard not his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life a man ought to auoide murder.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, by reason of murder committed, often it comes to passe that a whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie wife and children are vndone; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to begge, or be in greate miserie, yea
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20823:150"/>and sometime two families. Wherefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for their sakes men ought to refraine from killing, and from all meanes that may prouoke thereunto.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is death, as the Lord hath often saide, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.11.

            <p>Quest. <hi>What say you if a protestant match with a papist?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Considering that papists haue forsaken the couenant of God, are egregious idolaters, and in very deede deny Christ, in that they wilbe saued by their workes, there is neither scripture nor reason to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a protestants mariage with a papist. And they that so match themselues or their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, prouoke the Lords wrath greately. The mariage of the faithful is the meanes to increase the number of Gods elect, and is as it were the seminarie or seede plot of the Church. And for this cause the Church ought to be very circumspect that none of the faithfull marrie either with papist, Atheist, or Infidel, least in steede of a holy seede there spring vp in the Church a prophane seede, in steede of lawful heires cursed bastards. For commonly the children that come of such a mixture of holy and prophaine seede, proue to be monstrous wicked, as we reade in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. that the posteritie which came of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of the sonnes of God with the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:20823:151"/>of men, were giants, or tirants, wicked Apostates from God. As <hi>Anah</hi> let beastes of diuers kinds engender <hi>Gen.</hi> 36.24. contrary to the law <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.19. whereof come frute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les mules and machoes: so the posteritie that commeth of vnequall mariages, are for the most part barren and voide of all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines. And if such posteritie be fruitful,
<note place="margin">Plini. lib. 8. Chap. 16. &amp;c.</note> it is commonly in excessiue wickednes, as I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. And as the beast Thoes ing endered of a wolfe and of <hi>Hyaena Herodot. Lib.</hi> 4. as the Leopard ingendred of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the panther, and as others so ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of diuers kindes are of much fiercer &amp; more cruel nature, then the senerall kinds of beastes are; so the posteritie of such vnequal matches are like to be worse then either pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist or common Atheist, or infidel, as it may be seene vpon the borders of heathens when sometimes Christians and heathens marrie together. The like may be saide of the posteritie of <hi>Iewes</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, for some times there comes of them a third cast, as they cōmonly call them, which is worse then either of the parents. And though there be a greate difference betwene papists &amp; <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; Infidels, and a greate diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among papists themselues: yet it is in this, that some are not so bad as others,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20823:152"/>and if a protestant would be curious in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king choise of a papist, it is but as if out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poisons he would chuse the weakest. The reason which <hi>Malachi</hi> vseth <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.15. to reproue the <hi>Iewes</hi> both for mariages with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, and for their often diuorcements, is this, <hi>because (the Lord) sought a godly seede:</hi> and the same reason serueth fitly for this purpose. For if the <hi>Iewes</hi> marying among themselues, but sining in this, that they put away their first wife and tooke another, could not haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a godly seede or posteritie: how can they that marie with papists hope that their posteririe shalbe godly. What man desirous of pure good wheate, will in seed-time wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly mingle wheat and tares together, or good wheate and bad together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sowe his fielde and say he hopes all will proue verie good wheate in haruest? But as no simple man hath so little descretion, as thus to sowe his field: so I wish that wise Christians would not be so simple as to make a mariage betwene a protestant and a papist and say, they hope the children wilbe good christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>

               <note place="margin">What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of consangui nitie or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie may not marie.</note> Of the former the Lorde speaketh thus generally, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.6. <hi>None shall come neere to any of the kinred of his flesh to vncouer her shame: I am the Lord.</hi> The particulars are afterward declared in the same chapter to shew how far this general rule is to be extēded. And notwithstanding that euery man may read the text, yet I wil do mine endeuor to lay open the particulars very briefly in these three rules.</p>
            <p>First, a man may not mary his mother, his grandmother, or great grandmother, nor his daughter, nor his neece, nor his neeces daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eyther by consanguinitie or affinitie.</p>
            <pb n="290" facs="tcp:20823:153"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, a man may not marrie his aunt, or his great aunt eyther by consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitie or by affinitie; because they are as it were his mothers.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, a man may not marrie his sister by consanguinitie or affinitie.</p>
            <p>These three short and plaine rules containe in a manner the summe of all that eighteenth chapter of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> to vers. 18. where biga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is sorbidden. Notwithstanding that these three rules may more easily be conceiued of the simple, these two lessons must also be learned. First, that affinitie reacheth not so farre as consanguinitie, but stayeth onely in the husband and in the wife, and goeth no further vnto the consanguinitie of eyther of them. As for example, <hi>Dauid</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ishai,</hi> marieth <hi>Michal</hi> the daughter of <hi>Saul.</hi> Now all that are of consanguinitie to <hi>Dauid,</hi> are of affinitie to <hi>Michal:</hi> and all that are of consanguinitie to <hi>Michal,</hi> are of affinitie to <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the same degree of affinitie to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> as they are of consanguinitie to <hi>Michal. Dauids</hi> father, mother, brother, sister, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, aunt, cosen by consanguinitie; is <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chals</hi> father, mother, brother, sister, vncle, aunt, cosen by affinitie. But this affinitie resteth onely in <hi>Michal,</hi> and recheth not to any of her consanguinitie. So there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20823:153"/>is no affinitie at al betweene the kinred of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Michal. Ishai</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> are not made of any affinitie though their children be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried together. There is no affinitie betweene <hi>Eliab Dauids</hi> brother, and <hi>Merab Michals</hi> si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: there is no affinitie at all betweene <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Michals</hi> brother, and <hi>Zeruiah Dauids</hi> sister. The reason is, because propagation is by generation, as consanguinitie is spread farre by generation; affinitie is not made by generation, but by coniunction, as the word sheweth, <hi>affinis, qui ad alterius finem accedit,</hi> he is of affinitie, who commeth to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of an other kinred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, because sundrie inconueniences may fall out both in consanguinitie and in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie, whereby that which is not expresly forbidden in the word of God, may sundrie waiesbe vncōuenient, as in the mariage of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin germans in consanguinitie; and if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marie the daughter, and the sonne the mother, whereby affinitie is made: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we ought not alwaies to stand precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon that which is lawfull, but especially to respect what also is expedient, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle admonisheth vs, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. &amp;c. Therfore it behoueth magistrates to haue due regard of these matters, to determine what is conuenient, and all godly Christians ought
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20823:154"/>most duetifully to obey whatsoeuer the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate decreeth in these cases for edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and for honestie, and for auoyding of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences. For which cause also I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the table of degrees of mariage, which is set forth by authoritie, may heere be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There are specially three sortes of beleeuers,
<note place="margin">Persons vnapt for mariage.</note> which are not fit for mariage. First children, who for want of ripe age are not mariagable. Secondly, <hi>Eunuches,</hi> who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue that due beneuolence, which wedlok requireth. Of these Christ noteth three sortes. First those that are so borne, and haue na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall weakenes and imperfection that they cannot performe mariage dueties. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those that are made chast by men, that is, gelded men, who against their willes are by violence disabled to marie, as it hath beene and is too too common a practise in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> to geld men, that they may keepe the wiues and concubines of kings and of great men. <hi>Herodotus. lib.</hi> 8. writeth that one <hi>Panionius</hi> made a trade of these <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches,</hi> and solde them for great summes of money. But himselfe afterward receiued
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20823:154"/>a iustreward, and was made an <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motimus,</hi> whom before he had offered that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie vnto. <hi>Volataranus</hi> writeth that <hi>Coccei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Nerua</hi> forbad this wicked practise at <hi>Rome.</hi> Thirdly, those which make themselues chast for the kingdome of heauen, not as <hi>Origen</hi> did, of whom <hi>Eusebius Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. writeth, but as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. that is, by fasting, praying, watching, &amp; taking great paines in their calling; beate downe their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and bring it into subiection, and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of God the gift of continencie, that they may more freely and continually serue God, and not be hindred so much with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances of worldly affaires, as maried persons are. The thirde sorte of them that are vnfitte for mariage, are such as haue some foule contagious, infectious, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable disease, wherby the other party should be infected and depriued of mariage due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or else their children, if it were possible for them to haue any, shoulde be most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable lazers full of all sores and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Quest. <hi>Hitherto you haue shewed howe this commaundement is transgressed in mariage ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, you said also there was some thinges to be obserued in mariage after it was made.

            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ought to be chast and holy.</note> I will note onely two thinges. First, that the husband and the wife be faithfull and true each to other, and remember the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God (as <hi>Malachi, Chap.</hi> 2.14. admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the husband, and <hi>Salomon, Prou.</hi> 2.17. admonisheth the wife if you list to reade the places) &amp; not to commit adultery with other, which is the great sinne forbidden in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. The second thing I note in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageis that the husband &amp; the wife liue chastly, and soberly and honestly in that holy state of mariage; not wantonly, not lasciuiously, not worse then brute beastes. For which cause the Lorde that is holie, biddeth all his people to be holy, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19.2. and hath giuen maried persons a special precept, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.19. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord respecteth both the chast behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of maried persons, and also the welfare of their posteritie, as not only diuines, <hi>Pellicanus</hi> vpon the forenamed place, and <hi>Ierome, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius Caluin,</hi> and <hi>Lauaterus</hi> vpon <hi>Eze.</hi> 18.6. but also a very learned phisician <hi>Fernelius Pathologiae.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Quest. <hi>Now that you haue spoken of lawful contractes, and of holy wedlocke, declare also the faultes committed out of mariage against this commaundement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Many waies do vnmaried persons also breake this commaundement, as by fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:20823:155"/>and whoredome, when a single man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth a maid consenting to his lust contrary to the lawe. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.16. or lieth with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man betrothed to an husband, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.23.24. &amp;c. And if the priestes daughter play the whore, she must be burnt, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21.19. Also stewes and baudery are forbidden, <hi>Leui.</hi> 19.29. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.17. howsoeuer the Pope dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth with them. Also incest is forbidden whereof there are diuers examples, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.22. &amp; 38.18. &amp; 2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 13. &amp; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Also Sodomy and buggery, and all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and monstrous lust, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.22.23. Finally the vow of chastity in them that haue not the gift, is the mother of all filthines, and was first set on foote by <hi>Montanus</hi> and other knowen heretikes, and afterward defended by beastly papistes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> Quest. <hi>What is there more to be obserued in this commaundement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> As all these things are forbidden, so are all the meanes vnlawfull, whereby these thinges are procured, or maintained, which are many, &amp; first of all our senses may inflame the lustes of the heart, for by them lust enters into the heart, or rather is there kindled. For as gun-powder is all in aflame so soone as fire toucheth it; so the corruptions of the hearte are inflamed when the obiect of sinne ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:20823:156"/>in at our senses.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First,
<note place="margin">Of the sense of feeling.</note> because the sense of feeling or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should not haue too much libertie to roaue euery where, there is a prouiso made in a certaine case that a woman shall haue her hand cut off, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.11.12.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we may not suffer our eies to wander any way wantonly to looke vpon the beauty of a woman,
<note place="margin">Of the eyes.</note> for Christ saith, <hi>Math.</hi> 5.28. that such wanton lookes are adulteries. And the Apostles <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> condemne the lust of the eyes. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.16. &amp; 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. It is noted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.7. that <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife by casting her wanton eies vpon <hi>Ioseph,</hi> grewe vnto lust, and desired him to lie with her. <hi>Dauid</hi> looking from the top of his house at the first vpon a sudden, not thinking any such thing, after feeding the lust of his eye with more looking vpon <hi>Bathsheba</hi> the wife of <hi>Vrias,</hi> fell to further lust, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foule adulterie with her. But at an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time hee saide, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119.37. <hi>Turne away my eyes from regarding vanitie.</hi> And all men that feare GOD, and so feare their owne weakenes will pray with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and doe as <hi>Iob</hi> did, <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.1. <hi>I made a couenant with mine eies: why then shoulde I thinke on a maide?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, our cares ought to be shut from
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:20823:156"/>hearing filthie and vnchast speaches,
<note place="margin">Of hering</note> lest thereby our heartes should be kindled with lust. For as the wicked stop their eares least they should heare the word of God <hi>Psal.</hi> 58.4.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.57. or the piteous cry of the poore <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.13. so they that feare God truely, will stop their ears against al euil words and deedes as <hi>Esaiah</hi> saith <hi>Chap.</hi> 33.15. <hi>He that walketh in iustice, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, that shutteth his eyes from seeing of euill, he shal dwell on hie.</hi> For the holy spirit of God, dwelling in the elect, is grieued with hearing of euill words <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.30. And that is the cause why the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cannot abide to heare euil words.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, our tast must not be satisfied with euery pleasant meate and drinke; for the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prouerbe is, <hi>sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus,</hi> Lust is cooled when it wants daintie meates and strong drinke. But <hi>Salomon</hi> describeth the fruites of eating and specially of drinking wine <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.27. &amp;c. to the ende of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> and <hi>Vers.</hi> 29. saith thus; <hi>To whome is we? to whome is sorrow? &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Vers.</hi> 33. <hi>Thine eyes shall looke vpon strange women. Lot</hi> that liued honestly before, lay with his owne daughters when he was drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Dauid</hi> made <hi>Vriah</hi> drunken to prouoke him to lust 2, <hi>Sam.</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:20823:157"/>11.13.</p>
            <p>Besides these things which moue our senses and from thence enter into our heartes there are many other things which are prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to vncleannes.</p>
            <p>First strange apparel, that is, both newfangled fashions of apparel, and also such as is not meet for our sexe, as when a man weareth womans or a woman mans aparrel, which the Lord forbiddeth and detesteth as abominable <hi>De.</hi> 22.5. <hi>The woman shall not weare that which perteineth to the man, neither shall a man put on womans raimeut; for all that doe so, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omination to the Lord thy God.</hi> When eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one weareth his owne apparell, that is, the apparel of their sex, then both men and women are newfangle and desirous of strange fashions. And England hath the fashions almost of al other nations rounde about, and yet they are not content with any, but daily affect new guises, and when none can be found, then they renewe the ould, and that of late is become a fine fashion. But they must be content to he are what the Lord saith to the <hi>Iewes Zephan.</hi> 1.8. <hi>And it shalbe in the day of the Lords sacrifice, that I wil visit the princes, and the kings children, and all such as are clothed with strange apparrell.</hi> And apply this to their new fashions and see how
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:20823:157"/>they will agree together. It is to be feared, that except men and women breake off their sinnes by repentance, that these their new fashioned deuises neuer fitte their humors so well, but the iudgements of GOD for these and such like sinnes, will sit so close to their backes, that they cannot put it off when they would. But women at al times and in all ages haue surpassed men, as also at this day they doe, both for strangenes of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, and costlynes of the garment it selfe. And that women may see themselues eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and truely, I will shew them a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and a truer glasse to looke in, then there is any in all the <hi>Exchange.</hi> This true and cleare glasse is with the prophet <hi>Esai Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. and the rest following, <hi>Because the daughters of Zion are hautie, and walke with stretched out neckes, and with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring eyes walking and minsing as they goe, and making a tincleing with their feete, therefore shall the Lord make the heades of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Zion bald &amp;c.</hi> I wish al women to read the rest of the Chapter. And if they be loath to look in this glasse, for feare they shoulde see their deformities, yet they had better now se their faults while there is time to wash them away with teares of true repentance, then hereafter to feele the punishment, when
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:20823:158"/>it wilbe too late to repent. For will they, nil they, one day they must looke in this glasse when it shalbe set in their consciences, from whence they can neither remoue it, nor turne their eyes from beholding it. For the Lord wil shortly bring al flesh to iudgement, when none can be hidden from him that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon the throne. Wherefore I beseech all women, and specially those that make greater profession of religion, that they would tremble to dishonour God, to offend his little ones, to wound their owne soules, and cause the blessed word of God to be euill spoken of through their apparel, and that they would heare and follow the holy counsell of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9. likewise, I will, <hi>that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men adorne themselues in comely apparel, with shamefastnes and modestie, not with broythred haire of gould, or pearles, or costly apparel, but (as becommeth women that professe the feare of God) with good workes:</hi> and the counsel of <hi>Peter</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. <hi>whose appareling let it not be outward, as with broidred haire, and gould put about &amp;c.</hi> Man in the beginning was created good, holy pure, cleane, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deformitie, but afterward by his owne sinne he became euill, foule, filthie, vnclene, in so much that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> hauing once sinned, were ashamed of God, of themselues
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:20823:158"/>and each of other, and began to hide their filthines and their shame one from another with figge leaues <hi>Gen,</hi> 3.7. Wherefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the Lord made them coates of skins to hide their shame <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.21. But now a dayes there is a strange metamorphosis or change. For that which was appointed of God to hide and couer their shame, they haue changed into a thing that sets out their shame to the world. For doeth not the attire, the gesture, and the countenance both of men and women, shew the vncleannes of their heartes and bodies? <hi>Salomon</hi> saith <hi>Prou.</hi> 7.10. There came out a womā <hi>with an harlots attire:</hi> whereby he telleth vs that there is some attire which is whorish, and which bewrayeth the iniquitie of the minde.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, dauncing, as it is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vsed, is an intisement to folly,
<note place="margin">Of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</note> as lamē table experience may teach vs, if we be teach able. For young men and maides dance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and make such matches as bringe forth many bastards, <hi>Dinah Iacobs</hi> daughter was rauished without dancing. For she went out but to see or to be seene <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. And if the sight of <hi>Dinah</hi> inflamed <hi>Shechems</hi> luste, what will dauncing, kissing, and dalying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether more then modestly, doe. The fruite of <hi>Salomes</hi> wanton and whorish dauncing
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:20823:159"/>(for she was her mothers daughter) before <hi>Herode</hi> &amp; the rest, was the beheading of <hi>Io. Ba. Mah,</hi> 14.6. &amp;c. To speake of diuers kinds of dauncing, it needeth not, we haue too many by one. And to answer dauncing defenders, I would knowe of them whether they bring <hi>Dauids</hi> Psalmes, or baudie ballets with their pipes or other musicall instruments? And whether the dauncers com to refresh &amp; solace their heauy hearts, their sighing souls, their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful minds with some of the ioyfull songs of zion, or they come with disguised platformes to entrappe wanton women, to inflame their burning heartes, to feede their adulterous eyes, and to commit folly and defile their bodies. But if the dauncers be wantons, and come to delight their senses with vnlawful pleasure, and bring filthie and vnchristian sonnets, then no christian may for shame stand in their defence. Wherefore together with dauncing, <hi>I</hi> will put vnchast rimes, las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious songs, and sonnets, as prouokers &amp; allurements to kindle our prone nature to breake this commaundement.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Of stage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playes</note> stage-playing and enterludes, are euen Satans shop or schoole-house to bring vp prentices and young scholers to the arte and mysterie of whordome and adulterie. For the deuil hath nothing to teach such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20823:159"/>by, but it is all set abroade to open sale vpon the stage, and there it is either declared by foule and wicked words, or els most filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and impudently resembled by gestures and actions, that there is not a greater mart in the vniuersal world for the diuels wares, then is the stage. The first deuisers of it were the infidell heathens, from thence we receiue it, howsoeuer the Lord forbid a man to weare womans apparrell, surely he doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alow, that a man either in his owne or in womans apparel should vse adulterous &amp; filthie gestures. <hi>Cypryan Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epist.</hi> 10. demaunded by <hi>Eucratius,</hi> what he thought of a man, that began to be ashamed of his playing vpon the stage, gaue it ouer, and now did but only traine vp young scholers priuately in his chamber, to make them fit for the stage, answered, that man was a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>non erudiendorum, sed perdendorū puerorū,</hi> not of instructing, but of destroying youth, and therefore such a man was not worthie to be of the fellowship of the church. <hi>Tertullian Lib. de spectaculis</hi> saith, <hi>Theatrum propriè sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crarium veneris est,</hi> the theater, (or stage) properly is the chappell wherein whordome is committed.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:20823:162"/>that is to say, strangers, because they are strangers from their fathers inheritance (for a bastard cannot inherit, neyther among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, nor among infidels) and because they are straungers in some sorte from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lordes people, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Deutro.</hi> 23.2. <hi>A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the Lorde,</hi> namely, to beare office or to be aduanced to dignitie.

               <hi>Ans.</hi> First, they that by strong hand, and by their power and might take other mens goods from them. Such are the eues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that openly steale and rob at no one day in the hie waies or in any other place, as the <hi>Shabeans,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> which robbed <hi>Iob. Chapter.</hi> 1.15.17. Such are they that rob vpon the seas without a lawfull letter of mart. For if any man hauing sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no losse by any aduersarie, of a meere coueteous minde to get wealth by right or by wronge, will come to the magistrate, and before him make an open
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:20823:164"/>lowd ly &amp; say or swe are, that he hath sustained losse, when he neuer lost penie vpon the seas and so abuse authoritie to purchase a letter of mart, that man may not thinke he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue God. But if this be the beginning of his voiage, in abusing Gods lieutenant, in lying or in swearing falsely; what successe may he look for or what blessing, (I might say curssing) may he look for at gods hands? Nay with what conscience dare such a man enter the seas, wherein so mightie workes of the Lord are manifest euery moneth. Also if a man hauing a lawful letter of mart go beyond his cōmission, and count all fish that comes neere his net, and catcheth whatsoeuer he can get by mayn strength, where is this mans conscience? or what answeare will he make vnto the Lorde? It is meere foolish and irreligious to say as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe, such a one is an enimie to God, to the gospell, to our nation, and to me, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may lawfully rob him. For the Lorde hath neuer saide so in all his word. It is a meere deuise of thine owne, O man whosoeuer thou art, that saist so. For then say thus the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, the adulterer, the blasphemous swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, is an aduersarie to God, to religion, &amp; the gospell, to the welfare of our Land, &amp; therefore I will kill him, or I will rob him. No, no, it belongeth to the magistrate to
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:20823:165"/>punish him, and not to thee. The Lorde hath a greate number of aduersaries vpon earth, but no man may do them any violence but when the Lord biddeth, if then thou not commaunded by the magistrate, who is Gods vicegerent, yea forbid by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, (for when thou goest beyond thy cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, thou contrariest the magistrates commaundement) wilt for couetuousnes sake tak violently whatsoeuer thou cāst, thou hast no warrant for thy doing. The Lord can, and will, and doth punish his aduersaries, when, by whom, and by what maner it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serh him. Therefore except thou hast beene of the Lords counsell and knowest his will, seeke not too hastily to inrich thy selfe by rob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bery. Moreouer when any vnlawfully rob vpon the seas, and bring greate purchases into the land and into their houses, let the cursse neuer beforgotten, which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zachariah Chap.</hi> 5. saw in a vision of a flying booke, which goeth forth ouer the whole earth <hi>for euery one that stealeth shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be cut off aswel on this side, as on that; and euery one that sweareth, shalbe cut off aswell on this side, as on that, I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hostes, and it shall enter into the house of the thiefe, and into the house of him

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Quest. <hi>In what things doth vsurie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Vsurie cannot properly nor true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be saide to be in buying, in selling, in chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or changing, or in any such bargaining. For in all these and such like there may be, &amp; there is, fraud, guile, deceit, cosenage, cruelty, oppression, and iniurie; but no vsurie. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there vsurie in hiering out of houses, lands, cattell, or any other thing, but in setting, letting, hyring, there is fraude and oppression, as in the former. It remaineth then that vsurie in properly and truely in lending only, and in no other thing whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. But of lending there are twol ortes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called by two seuerall names in latin, though we haue but one english word for them both. For which cause I must of necessitie vse moe wordes then I woulde, that <hi>I</hi> may make a plaine difference betwen
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:20823:168"/>these two kindes of lending. The one kind of lending is, when the same thing that was lente, is to be restored againe, and not an other thing for it, as if a man lend his neighbour his cloak, his gowne, his horse, his carte, or any such other thing he looketh to haue the verie same againe which was lent, and not an other for it. The thing that is thus lent is properly called <hi>commodatum</hi> in latin. The other kind of lending is, when the same thing that was lent, is not looked for againe, but an other as good by weight, measure or number, as for example, a man lendeth his neighbour a loafe of bread, which the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower taketh as his owne, and eateth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storeth an other loafe for it as good and by weight. Againe a man boroweth a bushell of wheat and spendeth it, and after restoreth an other bushell as good and by measure. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, a man borroweth twentie shillings and layeth it out for necessary things, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter restoreth for it so much mony againe, &amp; by number. And this lending in latine is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed <hi>mutuum.</hi> This also must be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that all lending is free, and for nothing, but of good will: for if it be otherwise lente then franckly and for nothing, it hath another name. Now vsurie is properly in this latter kind of lending, and onely in it not in the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:20823:168"/>former, nor in any other kinde of dealing that is betweene men, whatsoeuer it be. The former kinde of lending is franke and free, of good will, for nothing: if it belent for any thing, then it loseth his name and is called, hired, for it is hired for such a thing, and for so much. This latter kinde of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is also franke, and free, of good will, for nothing. For if it be lent for something, it loseth his name, and is most properly and truely called vsurie. And thus you see plainely that vsurie consisteth in no dealing that is between men, but onely in len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yea, and in this latter kinde of len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely. And to make it more plaine, it is not alwaies in this kinde of lending, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when this lending, that ought to be franke and free, is abused to some gaine. So then vsurie is the abuse of this charitable len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Vsurie is a couenanted gaine for this latter kinde of lending, which is called <hi>mutuum</hi> in latine. And in this short definition you must marke these two things diligently. First that it is a couenanted gaine. For when a man lendeth frankely, and freely, of meere good
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:20823:169"/>will, of conscience to succour and helpe him that is in neede, according as God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; if the borrower restoring the valewe of the thing againe in due time and according to his promise, and according to his habilitie, wil in such a case freely giue something to the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, because he hath gained much by that which was lent him freely, it is not vsurie in such a case to receiue that the borower frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giueth: but this case is so rare, as it scarse needes to be named. Therefore to make it v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie, there must be a couenanted gaine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that it is a couenanted gaine in the latter kind of lending onely, and not in the former</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Quest. <hi>Thirdly then, how many kinds of vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie are there?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know but onely one kinde of vsurie, and no moe; which is worth the marking, and hereafter will giue great light for the deciding of the controuersie, whether it be lawfull or no. For though some men committe vsurie in money, some in corne, some in bread, and others in other thinges, which make a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the obiect of vsurie; yet the nature of vsurie is not by these thinges deuided. Wherefore I say againe, there is but one kind of vsurie onely.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Quest. <hi>Now lastly, whether is vsurie a thing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20823:169"/>lawfull or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I knowe it is no small controuersie among many at this day, and hath beene a long time, neuerthelesse because the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it falleth necessarily into the eight com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandement, I will speake plainely what I thinke, and so referre and submit my selfe and my reasons to the censures of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned in any place. I am of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that to take couenanted increase or lucre for lending of any thing that is put to vsurie is simplie vnlawfull, vnderstanding such kinde of lending as I named before, which in latine is properly called <hi>mutuum.</hi> For vsurie is not properly, neyther can be in that other kinde of lending, which is called <hi>commodatum.</hi> I am constrained to vse the latine wordes, because we haue but onely one English worde for these two kindes of lending. My reasons which moue me to thinke that vsurie is altogether vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, are these.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the worde of the Lorde, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.35. manifestly forbiddeth to lende vpon vsurie, for vsurie, or for lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre and gaine to any of the Lordes people, which are decayed and brought vnto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, that they are not able to maintaine their estate. The wordes be these, <hi>Exod.</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:20823:170"/>22.25. <hi>If thou lend money to my people,</hi> that is, <hi>to the poore with thee, thou shalt not be as an vsurer vnto him: yee shall not impose vsurie vppon him.</hi> And Leuit, 25.35. <hi>Moreouer if thy brother be impouerished, and fallen in decay with thee, thou shalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue him, yea the stranger and soiourner, that he may liue with thee. Thou shalt take no vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of him, nor vantage but thou shalt feare thy GOD, that thy brother may liue with thee. Thou shalt not giue him thy money to vsurie, nor lende him thy vitailes for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in <hi>Deut,</hi> 23.19. it is thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: <hi>Thou shall not giue to vsurie to thy brother: as vsurie of money, vsurie of meate, vsurie of any thing that is put to vsurie. Vnto this stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger thou maist lend vpon vsurie, but thou shalt not lend vpon vsurie to thy brother that the Lorde thy God may blesse thee in all that thou settest thine hande to, in the lande whither thou goest to possesse it.</hi> In these wordes there is a generall opposition betweene this stranger, that is, the cursed <hi>Cananites,</hi> and their brethren the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Where this oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is to be obserued. For when the Lorde permitteth the <hi>Iewes</hi> to lend vpon vsurie to that stranger, he doth not meane all stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> wrest the place, euen to this
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:20823:170"/>day. For in the place before cited, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.35. the Lorde forbad the <hi>Iewes</hi> to giue vpon vsurie, not onely to their brethren the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but also to the stranger and soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is, to such strangers and soiourners as seeing the great workes of the Lorde and his fearefull iudgementes vpon <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke <hi>Aegypt</hi> and went out with the <hi>Israelites Exo.</hi> 12.38. And many of them were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, and receiued the religion of the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and worshipped the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Such also were <hi>Moses</hi> his father in lawe and those that came with him, and dwelt with the <hi>Israelites</hi> and worshipped GOD as they did, and afterwarde in the scripture are called <hi>Kenites.</hi> Such also were others that ioyned themselues to the <hi>Israelites</hi> and dwelt amonge them. Wherefore it is often said concerning many thinges, that there shall be one lawe for the <hi>Iewe</hi> borne and for the stranger. But when the Lord permitted the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> to lend vpon vsury to that straunger, he meaneth onely those cursed people, the <hi>Hittites,</hi> the <hi>Girgashites,</hi> the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> the <hi>Perizites,</hi> the <hi>Hinites,</hi> and the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> whom the Israelites, were commaunded to destroy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.27. &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.52. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.1.2.16. and no other strangers. Now as we see to what strangers
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:20823:171"/>they might lende vpon vsurie: so we must knowe that to their brethren whether they were Iewes borne or strangers and soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that dwelt among them, they might not lende vpon vsurie. Then whether they be rich or poore, that is no distinction to make vsurie lawfull or vnlawfull: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of those seauen cursed nations or not. For if they be of those cursed people, it was lawfull to lend to them vpon vsurie: if they were not of them, it was vnlawfull. And thus the Lorde sheweth by a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of people, namely of these cursed, and of all others, to whome it was lawfull, and to whome it was vnlawfull to lende vpon vsurie. This newe founde distinction of rich men and poore men was neuer made by the Lord, neyther hath it any warrant of the word of God, but onely some men couetously min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, haue coyned it of late yeares. And if we will approue our consciences before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, we must say, Lorde, thine owne mouth hath spoken it, thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded it, it is written for my direction and instruction in such a place of the scripture, and therefore, Lorde, I did it, else I woulde neuer haue attempted it, no not to saue my life, much lesse to increase my wealth. And whatsoeuer or whosoeuer shall otherwise shift
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:20823:171"/>it of before men, shal euen be speechles before God. Neuerthelesse this is to be confessed, that the intendment of the holy Ghost in the forenamed places, is to forbid lending vpon vsurie to the poore: but we must heree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall take the reason; because it was then practised onely vpon the poore, and it was an vncouth and vtterly vnknowen or heard of monster, that rich men should borrow of rich men vpon vsurie, and that of meere couete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes. For though there were many greate sinnes among the Israelites, yet this monster I suppose was then vnhatched No this kinde of vsurie is not once mentioned so much as in the last prophets, when perhaps such seede of cruell couetousnes was sowen, as we now reape the fruite of. But we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that it is not onely the labourer that by his daily worke getteth his liuing, nor yet the meane husbandman, that is called poore, or said to be impouerished in the scripture; but also the rich farmer, the wealthy marchant, the landed gentleman, or others of greate calling, sometimes fall into decay, and wax poore, so that they haue as great neede to borrowe, as anie poore labourer. For the GOD of heauen that ruleth all thinges after the counsell of his will, sometimes bringeth downe great men, and exalteth
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:20823:172"/>them of lowe degree. Wherefore the Lords meaning is, that if thy brother (whether he be labourer, artificer, husbandman, yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, marchant, gentleman, or nobleman) be impouerished and decaied, and his state beginne to fall, that then thou shoulde lend vnto him freely to helpe him, to vphold him, to maintaine his lawfull state and calling, but thou shalt not impose vsurie vpon him, that is, when he is falling, thou shalt not strike him downe and treade him vnder thy feete, but thou shalt take him by the hande, vpholde him from falling, and let thy strength, thy wealth support his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. For the Lorde offereth thee such an occasion to trie thee, whether thou wilt obey the Lorde thy GOD, and relieue him that hath neede of thy helpe, or thou wilt answere him, as <hi>Nabal</hi> answered <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.10. And for this cause I beseech all that feare GOD, to consider the reason which the Lorde vseth, <hi>Deutro.</hi> 23.20. <hi>That the Lorde thy God may blesse thee in all that thou settest thine hande to,</hi> to perswade men, freely and without vsurie to lende to them that are impouerished and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied, as if the Lord had said, as thou would haue me to blesse thee, so helpe thou and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue him that is decayed.</p>
            <pb n="329" facs="tcp:20823:172"/>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, that which the Lord permitted the <hi>Iewes</hi> to doe for the punishment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the cursed <hi>Canaanites,</hi> cannot possiblely be turned to a blessing to Gods people. But the Lord permitted the <hi>Iewes</hi> to lend vpon vsurie to the <hi>Canaanites</hi> for a kind of punishment to destroy them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Therefore if one brother lend to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon vsurie, whether he be rich or poore, it is to punish, and to destroy him, as wofull experience teacheth vs how true this is: for many whole families, man, wife, and children are destroyed and vndone by vsurie. The gallows are permitted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued to the sheriffe or to some other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to hang vp theeues, murderers, and such other malefactors, but God forbid that we should thinke them meete for good men. And so vsurie was permitted to the <hi>Iewes</hi> as a gallous, as a gibbet, or such other punishment to destroy the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and how then can it be good for the Lords people.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I reason thus. Where the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall is not warranted, there ought to be no couenanted and warranted gaine. But in this kinde of lending, which is called <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi> and wherein only vsurie is, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall is not warranted. And therfore there is no warrant in the word of God for vsutie.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:20823:173"/>That the principall ought not to be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it may appeare two wayes. First by cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisō, &amp; secondly by scripture. The cōparison shalbe betweene those two kindes of lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherof I spake before. For if in the former kind of lēding, (where the same thing that was borrowed, is to be restored againe, &amp; wherein lesse fauour is shewed to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower) the principall be not warranted, then much lesse ought it to be warranted in this second kinde of lending, where grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fauour is shewed to the borrower. But in the former kind of lending the principal is not warranted, if it perish without any falt of the borrower as it is <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.14. <hi>And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or else dye. The owner thereof not being present</hi> (and therfore might suspect it perished through the misusage of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower) <hi>he</hi> (that is, the borrower) <hi>shal surely make it good. If the owner therof be by, he</hi> (that is the borrower <hi>shal not make it good.</hi> Therfore in this second kinde of lending the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ought much lesse to be warranted. The scripture to proue that the principall ought not to be warranted in this second kinde of lending, is written <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. where the Lord commaundeth, that euery seuenth yere should be a yere of freedom for diuers things.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:20823:173"/>And if any man had lent any thing to his brother, which the borrower was not able to pay againe before the yere of libertie, that then the lender should freely remit and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the debter the principall; the wordes are these <hi>Deut:</hi> 15.2. <hi>And this is the manner of the freedome: euery creditour shall quite the loue of his hand which he hath lent to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: he shall not aske againe of his neighbour, nor of his brother: for the yere of the Lords freedome is proclaimed.</hi> Seeing then the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal is not warranted, but must be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and forgiuen, if the borrower be not able to repaye it againe, according to Christs wordes <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. <hi>lende looking for nothing agaiue,</hi> there is no scripture to allow lucre and gaine for the principall, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and so no vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie alowed by the word of God.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>I</hi> finde but one kinde of vsurie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the scripture, and that alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, neuer approued, as it may appeare in the three places alledged before out of the law, and <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.5. &amp;. 109.11. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.8. <hi>Eze.</hi> 8.13. &amp; 22.12. and wheresoeuer else it is mentioned. Wherefore vsurie is not lawfull by the word of God. </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, I saide before, that vsurie is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of lending. For when men couenante for some lucre and gaine for the lending of
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:20823:174"/>that which the Lord commaundeth to be lent freely, and without any vsurie, then they abuse lending. Now the abuse of a thing cannot be iustified, and therefore vsurie is condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seauenthly, vsurie is a thing so repugnant to nature and reason, that not only Christian nations, but heathens also, whose chiefest scholmaister is that instinct which is grauen in their natures, doe disalow ssurie through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. For I neuer heard or read of any that doe approue of vsurie. Wherefore that which the Lord disaloweth in his word, and all nations vnder heauen mislike, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be lawful, neither ought Christians to defend it.

And that because they will buie all the Lands that lies neere them, or are cōmodious for them, because the poore shall haue no place to dwel in, but by their leaue and good liking, because they wilbe richer then their fellowes, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally because they are not cōtented with that blessed state the Lord hath set them in this life, &amp; because they are not thankful to God that hath made thē able to liue very plentiful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and to be cōfortable and helpeful to many besides, whereas he could, and can, and sometime doeth for mens ingratitude, pull dowen vnsatiable couetous men, and setteth vp the meeke and lowlie. And I thinke these borrowers vpon vsurie sinne greatly, and that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:20823:175"/>for two causes,</p>
            <p>The first cause which moueth me so to thinke, is the couetous greedie minde, that moueth them to borrow vpon vsurie, when in trueth they haue no neede, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to be content with their estate, and leaue that for others to buie and purchase which of themselues they are not able to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe but by this vnlawfull meanes of borrow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing vpon vsurie.</p>
            <p>The second cause is taken from the effects that follow vpon this vnlawfull borrowing v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vsurie which are many but I will at this present obserue two effects onlie.</p>
            <p>First these borrowers vpon vsurie, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the cursed vsurer, as the receiuer doth maintaine the these. For though there are many of the first sort of borrowers, whom necessitie constraineth to borrow, and the moe a greate deale by these meanes, yet they all are not able to hould so many vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers plowes going all the yere long as we see there are, but many vsurers should be constrained to cease from making so long furrowes vpon poore mens backes, and buckle themselues to some better trade.</p>
            <p>The second effect is, that the poore are greatly hindred, and halfe vndone, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that these men borrow vpon vsurie. For
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:20823:176"/>these borrowers vpon vsurie, giue so exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely much for the lone of monie, that they must either giue vp housekeeping, and take a chamber in the corner of a house in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> for a time, or else greately dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their house-keeping, that by pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sparing that way, they may get vp somwhat towards the paying of the exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue vsurie, which the tormenting vsurer hath bound them vnto, Whereupon it followeth that the poore which were wont to be set on worke, no we liue idlie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out maintenance, and which were wont to be relieued with much comfort, are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, and shut out of the doores, and sigh and grone vnto the Lord for very miserie. O would to God these rich borrowers vpon v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie would thinke it a more glorious thing for them to feede and cloath the poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Iesus Christ with some parte of that great wealth the Lord hath made them ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of, euen for this cause among others, that they should comfort the needie <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.27. and so honour God with their riches <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.9. then by vnlawfull meanes to purchase much vpon earth to the great hurt and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of the poore. For this pinching in house keeping to fill vp the vsurers bagges, is the vndoing of the poore.</p>
            <pb n="337" facs="tcp:20823:176"/>
            <p>But besides these two generall effectes, each of the borrowers vpon vsurie, hath his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar effectes. The gentlemen bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing vpon vsurie to buy more landes, rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his rentes, and makes all the poore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to pay the vsurie. The farmer or yeoman selleth his corne and his cattell so much the dearer, and makes the buyer to pay his vsury. The marchant inhaunseth the price of his wares, and who so needes his marchandize, must pay his vsurie. And thus the cursed vsurer (for he is no where not so much as once bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the word of God, but continually cursed, besides the pitifull sighing of the poore which sendeth to God a daily curse against him into heauen) he is the head of all this mischiefe; the rich bowers, they are his vpholders; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the poore commonaltie, they haue all the burden laid on their backs, though of al others they be least able. And thus the vsurers croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked plowe goeth forward.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> If you remember the degrees by which the Lord proceedeth in these fiue last commandements, as I haue noted them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the beginning of the sixt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then shal you see that here in this ninth commaundement the Lord forbiddeth a man any way to impaire the credit, name, or good estimation of his neighbour. And for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Lord elsewhere in the scripture som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time setteth before vs the excellencie of a good name to make vs more carefull of it, and sheweth how pretious a thing it is in the book of the preacher, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.3. saying, <hi>A good name is better then a good oyntment.</hi> And in another place he saith, <hi>A good name is to be chosen aboue

And sometime to dehort vs from staining the credit and good name of our neighbour, he setteth out a false witnesse bearer in his proper colours, and saith, <hi>A man that beareth false witnesse against his neighbour is like an hammer, &amp; a sword, &amp; a sharpe arrow, Pro.</hi> 25.28. And yet for more safety of a mans good name, the Lord that made this law hath backed it or seconded it with an otherlawe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. <hi>One witnesse shall not rise against a man for any trespasse, or for any sin or for any fault thathe offendeth in.</hi> There is no exceptiō eyther of person or cause, as it is more manifest, <hi>Deu.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Num.</hi> 35.50. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.16. but there must be two witnesses at the least, to proue any man to be otherwise then he professeth himselfe to be, and so to impeach his good name that he caried before. So great care hath the Lord e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of our credit and good name among them. Whereby euery man is admonished to walke soberly &amp; sincerely in his calling, that he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire not his owne good name by worde or deede: and also to follow the Lords example, and be carefull to maintaine, not captious or sclaunderous to impeach the good name of his neighbour. </p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> In all the former commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, some outward acte or deed was commaunded or forbidden, but in this last the Lorde forbiddeth only the desire of the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Quest. <hi>You saide afore in euerie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that the outward facte, was not only forbidden, also the inward desire of the heart, and you shewed it plainely out of Math</hi> 5.21. <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 15.9. <hi>how then commeth it now to passe that this commaundement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth nothing but that which was a parcell of each of the former commaundements?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> My former answeare was sufficient, but not manifest enough to make plaine to euery one the difference betwene this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement and the other nine which goe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:20823:182"/>before, therefore <hi>I</hi> will briefely make the difference as plaine as I can.</p>
            <p>First, that you may be fully perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that these wordes are not only a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or declaration of some things forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the nine commaundements going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but a new and an other commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement euen the tenth (for you heard in the beginning out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13, that there are ten commaundements) expressed by an other word, whereon yet I will not stand, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> shall answere you <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. who daily examining his owne wayes, and his owne heart by the cōmaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the Lord, still supposed that bare thought and wandring lust had beene no sinne, till he came to this tenth &amp; last commaundement, where he found it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>thou shalt not lust.</hi> In consideration whereof he found himselfe deeplier guiltie of sinne, then before he supposed he had beene. Wherefore his wordes are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and sufficient to teach vs that here is an other commaundement, euen the tenth, both here, and also <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.21. in the tenth place.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondlie now to declare the difference betweene this tenth commaundement and the other nine, we must consider sinne, and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:20823:183"/>the degrees thereof from the beginning to the end. And first of all there is originall sinne in euery man as the scripture beareth record <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7.31. which is not only sinne of it selfe but also the roote, from whence other sinnes doe bud and spring, and shoot foorth themselues, the fountaine from whence other sinnes flow and the nurce which feedeth and cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth other sinnes. In the second place we are to consider the fruites of this originall sinne,
<note place="margin">Four fruits of the ori<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</note> which are four in number and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree one proceeding after another, and as it were growing one out of another, or one vpon another</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And first out of original corruption, as out of a filthie puddle or chanell when it is stirred arise a sinfull concupiscence or lust with out consent of will, as it may best appeare in young children. For as that lust appeareth in them before they be come to the other three degrees following: so we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it lurketh still in mans nature though in riper yeres it be not so manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the second place there is the very same lust growne vp with age, and augmented with a generall and wandring consent of the heart, as it were with another fruite, which men shew forth when they say in their hearts,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:20823:183"/>and some times with their mouths, I would this mans house, landes, cattell, seruant, wife, maide, &amp;c. were mine. Whereby they declare that they couet other mēs goods, and lust after them with an vnsetled and with a roauing consent of the heart, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny endeauour to obtaine the thing that is desired.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this former lust groweth vp, still increaseth as it were a new and third branch, as being growen taller and stronger then it was before, by a full, setled, and resolute consent of the heart, not only generally to wish and couet, but also to endeauour to obtaine that which is desired. And this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire sheweth itselfe in deedes also, as the former did in words only. For after a man hath so resolutely wished &amp; lusted after his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods, that he will haue them if he can get them, he alwayes vseth meanes to obtaine them as occasion serueth. As if he lust after his neigybours fielde, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did after <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, he will seeke and vse all meanes to get it by force or by fraude. If he cannot flatter him, and fetch him in with intising words, then wil he finde some quirk, proue it concealed land, or enter some acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against him to vndoe him, and by meere oppression obtaine it.</p>
            <pb n="352" facs="tcp:20823:184"/>
            <p>The fourth and last fruit of originall sinne is, when things so vnlawfully desired, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise obteined vnlawfully. And this fourth and last degree the Apostle Iames <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15. of his epistle, calleth perfect sin, or sin finished. The fruit whereof springing from originall sin, and growing vpon the verie toppe of all these foure branches is death, as the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith.</p>
            <p>Now of these four braunches growing out of originall corruption, I passe ouer the first, as not mentioned expresly in this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because it is without any consent of heart, which consent is the thing here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. For this tenth commaundemente is not only <hi>thou shalt not lust,</hi> but there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>thy neighbours house. &amp;c.</hi> to shew that here is forbid a lust with consent of hearte. For no man can couet his neighbours house but with consent of heart. The second branch then, which is coueting and lusting after our neighbours goods with a roauing and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring desire (but without any setled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute minde to obteine it if we may) is the thing that is forbidden in this last commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. The third and fourth braunches are the desires and deedes which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in the former commaundements.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the thing forbidden in this last
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:20823:184"/>commaundement (that I may repeate it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine) is a roauing and raunging lust with a generall consent of the heart to wish it, yet so that a man should checke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his owne heart, rather then he would his desire should be accōplished. If a man couet his neighbours wife with a wandring kinde of lust, &amp; if there were opportunitie to enioy her, but yet he would refuse her and sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his ranging desire, euen his lust is here forbidden. Which teacheth vs what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of loue to God, to our neighbours, and what holynes of life these commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of the Lord require at our handes. Wherefore let vs follow the counsel of <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. and cleanse ourselues from al fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of the flesh and spirite, and grow vp vnto ful holines in the feare of God. And who so meditateth herein daily, shall finde suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause in himselfe to humble himselfe before the Lord, as finding himselfe deeply guiltie of much transgression, that though he once thought with <hi>Paul</hi> that he was aliue without the Law, yet now behoulding his soule in this and in the former commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as his face in a glasse, he shal see that sinne reuiueth, and that he him selfe is dead <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>In what particular branches wil you
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:20823:185"/>inlarge this commandement?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former commaundements each one hath his proper obiect, but the obiect of this commaundement goeth through all the rest of the second table, and in this is to be inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, namely in coueting our neighboures house, land, wife, seruant, oxe, &amp;c. And the opening of one of these, shal serue for all. If a sonne hauing a couetous desire and wandring lust in his heart, and say thus in his heart, <hi>I</hi> would I were in possession of my fathers inheritance, he breaketh his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, though he neuer vtter it in word. And there are too many sonnes now a daies, which thinke their parents liue too long. For if the poet could say long since, <hi>filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos,</hi> the sonne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten counts his fathers age before he dye: we haue no cause to perswade vs that this is the golden age, but rather that according to the dreame of <hi>Nebuchad-nezzer Dan.</hi> 2. the golden heade, the siluer breastes, the bra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sen thighs are long since past, and we now liue in the time of the yron leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the feete whereof are partly yron, partly clay. For euen the loue betweene the father and the sonne sometimes is like the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>herence of yron and clay. Againe if any rich <hi>Ahab</hi> desire his neighbour <hi>Naboths</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:20823:185"/>house or land, though he neuer vse. <hi>Ahabs</hi> meanes to purchase it, yea though he would not haue it vnlawfully though he might, yet when he shall appeare before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seate of Iesus Christ, and the bookes or bills of inditements be reade, then shal he finde that wandring desire written in his own conscience with the point of a Diamond that it cannot be rased or blotted out, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he truly repent him of all his sinnes, &amp; by a liuely faith wipe it out with the blood of Iesus Christ. Wherefore as euery man examining his owne soule shall finde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe guiltie of the breach of this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in any one thing, so let him trie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the rest, and therevpon humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and fal downe before the throne of grace, that in Iesus Christ our high priest, he may finde grace to helpe in time of neede <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. For Iames saith <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. <hi>The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that dwelleth in vs, lusteth after enuie. And Dauid saith Psul.</hi> 94.11. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanitie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Quest. <hi>One question more I would demand, and it is this. Whether God hath giuen this law, these ten commaundements, that a man by keeping them may purchase to himselfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal blessednes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. I</hi> haue alreadie dissolued part of this
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:20823:186"/>doubt before in the first part, when I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red your 50. question. Neuerthelesse I will giue you another answere to your demaund now, and repeate one answere twise ouer for to make it plaine.</p>
            <p>First when <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, euen the sixt day of the creation, God did not create him cursed and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and then gaue him a law by which he might merit blessednes: but God first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated him good, blessed, &amp; holy, &amp; gaue him a blessed and happie life. Then afterward the Lord gaue to <hi>Adam</hi> a law <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. &amp;c, not to purchase a happie life, for he had a blessed life giuen him before at his creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that by keeping the law which God gaue him, he might continue still in Gods fauour, and in that blessed state of his creation: for by transgressing the law he lost the blessed life which God had giuen him.</p>
            <p>And this was the vse of the Law in the beginning, before the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, when all man-kinde was lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> because of his disobedience as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you in the beginning of the first part, there was none of all <hi>Adams</hi> posteritie that could redeeme himselfe by his workes, and merit the blessed life he had lost. For if man in innocencie could not keepe Gods
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:20823:186"/>Law that he might continew in that blessed life he had receiued of God, much lesse is he able to recouer that he lost, seing he is now farre weaker then he was before. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord that is rich in mercie, and hath mercie on whome he will, did promise Christ, and in fulnes of time sent Christ, to take our humaine nature vpon him, and so by the sacrifice of his owne bodie once on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offred vpon the crosse to make full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our sinnes, and so reconcile vs to God againe. And thus by the death of Christ, and not by merits of men, we are reconciled to God, and restored to life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Now the Lord, that of his mercy hath thus brought vs to blessednes againe, doth not leaue vs lawles to liue as we list, &amp; do what we wil, but hath the second time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so giuen vs his lawes againe, not to purchase life thereby, for of his mercie in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus our Lord he hath giuen vs a blessed life the second time, but that by continuing in obedience to his commaundements, and by keepeing of the law, we might abide &amp; continue in the same blessed life which he hath freely giuen vs, and not by transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it as <hi>Adam</hi> did, lose our happie life as <hi>Adam</hi> did. And this is the vse of the law now to vs al that are reconciled to God in Christ,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:20823:187"/>euen absolutely and intirely to keepe the whole Law of God that we may abide bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for euer: for if we but once breake any jot of Gods Law, we lose our blessednes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as <hi>Adam</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Lord seing that <hi>Adam</hi> in his in nocencie did not keepe the law and that we in our corruption, though reconciled to God, are lesse able to keepe the law then <hi>Adam</hi> was, hath also giuen Christ Iesus to be our righteousnes. Christ hath fulfilled the whole law of God for vs, and imputeth his disobedience to vs that beleeue in him, and therefore we desire with <hi>Paul</hi> to be founde, not hauing our owne righteousnes of the law but hauing the righteousnes of Iesus Christ. And thus in Christ and by Christ it is that we keepe the whole law, and so continue in the blessed life which is purchased for vs by Christs death.</p>
            <p>Now it remaineth for vs, not to giue ouer our selues to all vncleanenes, but to striue to the perfection of that sanctification which is begunne in vs by the spirit of God, and so to walke after the motions of the spirit, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the lusts of the flesh, as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. &amp; 7.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>Now that you haue spoken of faith, of the sacraments, and of the ten commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:20823:187"/>it remaineth, that, according to your owne order propounded before, you should speake of prayer. Wherefore I pray you proceede to open that also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I propounded it, as you say, and this is the proper place for it, that whether we giue thankes to God for any blessing and grace receiued either for our bodies, or for our soules, or for both: or else we craue any thing at Gods hands, as increase of faith, cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the sacraments, or strength against the enemies of our saluation, and power to walke after the spirit, we should haue a directi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on out of Gods word that our prayers framed according to the wil of God, might be accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>table to him. And for this purpose the Lords prayer as the chiefest in all the word of God, for this purpose, were to be taken in hand, and laide out in his seueral partes and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches together with the vse of each part. And there are in it four things chiefely to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered: first a preface in the first words; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a petition or crauing of such things as concerne Gods glorie and our necessitie in the four first petitions, thirdly a deprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or desiring of God to put those things farre from vs, which are or might be hurtfull or dangerous vnto vs in the two last petitions, and fourthly the conclusion in the last wordes.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:20823:188"/>But by reason that I haue bene longer in the three former partes of faith, of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and specially of the law, then I was purposed, and for other occasions I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at this present goe forward with prayer, as I haue done with the rest.</p>
